# Modeling Subjective Assessments of Guilt in Newspaper Crime Narratives

This is the GitHub repository for our paper ["Modeling Subjective Assessments of Guilt in Newspaper Crime Narratives"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09589). 

## SuspectGuilt Corpus

We are excited to share the SuspectGuilt Corpus: a collection of 474k local news crime reports from across the US. 1821 of these stories were selected for further annotation. We recruited over 2000 workers on Amazon's Mechanical Turk who rated 

* how likely they considered the suspect(s) of a story to be guilty (**reader perception**), and 
* how much the author of the report believes that the suspect(s) are guilty (**author belief**). 

For each question, annotators also highlighted why they gave their response. Since guilt judgments are subjective and known to be highly variable each crime report was annotated by at least 5 workers.

We would like to encourage more research in the domain of crime reporting and specifically guilt perception. **To receive our corpus, please send an email to ekreiss@stanford.edu or zijwang@stanford.edu.** This corpus presents an extensive collection of news articles with rich guilt rating and highlighting annotations, as well as the annotators' self-reported age, gender, and native language information. 

Note: We don't own any distribution rights of the collected crime reports.
