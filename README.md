# Modeling Subjective Assessments of Guilt in Newspaper Crime Narratives

This is the GitHub repository for our paper "[Modeling Subjective Assessments of Guilt in Newspaper Crime Narratives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09589)" in proceedings of CONLL'20 by Elisa Kreiss\*, Zijian Wang\* and Christopher Potts. 



## SuspectGuilt Corpus

We are excited to share the SuspectGuilt Corpus: a collection of 1,821 annotated local news crime reports from across the US. We recruited over 2000 workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk who rated 

* how likely they considered the suspect(s) of a story to be guilty (**reader perception**), and 
* how much the author of the report believes that the suspect(s) are guilty (**author belief**). 

For each question, annotators also highlighted why they gave their response. Since guilt judgments are subjective and known to be highly variable, each crime report was annotated by at least 5 workers.

We would like to encourage more research in the domain of crime reporting and specifically guilt perception. **To receive our corpus, please send an email to ekreiss@stanford.edu and zijwang@stanford.edu.** This corpus presents an extensive collection of news articles with rich guilt rating and highlighting annotations, as well as the annotators' self-reported age, gender, and native language information. Note that we don't own any distribution rights of the collected crime reports.

For more details,  please refer to our paper and the `annotation` dir, which contains code for the annotation experiment and a detailed corpus analysis.


## Modeling
### Genre Pretraining
Please refer to `modeling/run_lm_finetuning.py`. Example command (requires the 474k dataset to run):

```
python run_lm_finetuning.py --fp16  --output_dir ./uncased_model_100k/ --mlm --save_steps 5000 --max_steps 100000  --model_name_or_path bert-base-uncased --do_lower_case --warmup_steps 5000 --do_train --do_eval --eval_all_checkpoints
```

### BERT Model
Please refer to `modeling/model/main.py`. Example command (requires the annotated dataset to run):
```
python main.py --num_train_epochs 5 --token_cls --do_lower_case --seed 0 --token_ratio 0 --training_head 0 --output_dir ./temp_model --learning_rate 3e-05 --do_train --do_eval --overwrite_output_dir --eval_all_checkpoint
```


### Analysis

The main results are in `modeling/result_analysis.ipynb`. Please refer to `modeling/interpret.ipynb`
for an example of running Integrated Gradients on our dataset using [captum](https://captum.ai/tutorials/).
