{"story_id":1522,"story_clean":"The case against a\u00a0Frankfort pediatrician charged with groping women in his office was put on hold while lawyers sift through medical records. Kishor Jain, 60, was arrested in February and\u00a0faces 10 counts of felony criminal sexual abuse, five counts of misdemeanor battery, and a single count of criminal sexual assault for allegedly groping five women while working at the\u00a0Hedges Clinic. Jain\u00a0stopped working at the clinic soon after he was hit with the charges. Before he was arrested, Jain was named in the first of what turned into\u00a0four civil lawsuits\u00a0alleging he groped, fondled and sexually assaulted women while working as a doctor. A fifth lawsuit accuses Jain of\u00a0sexually assaulting a minor child.

{"story_id":1714,"story_clean":"Two men accused of stealing cash, checks and sacramental wine from a Ramona church pleaded not guilty Thursday to burglary charges. Christopher Szumski, 34, and Brandon Tye, 19, were arrested Tuesday in a traffic stop on Interstate 8 near Main Street in El Cajon, according to San Diego County sheriff's Lt. Hank Turner. During interviews with detectives, Szumski and Tye allegedly admitted breaking into St. Mary's Episcopal Church in Ramona April 14 and ransacking it. Among the losses were safes, cash, checks and sacramental wine, Turner said. The suspects also allegedly confessed to a residential burglary in San Marcos. Stolen property was found when officers searched the vehicle the two were in when they were stopped, according to Turner. Szumski and Tye are charged with two counts each of burglary at the church and one of residential burglary in connection with the San Marcos burglary.

{"story_id":1771,"story_clean":"Two weeks after the body of a 76-year-old Arcadia grandmother was found in her backyard, officials arrested and charged a Pasadena man with Capital murder, burglary and robbery Tuesday.  On April 9, the body of Chyong Jen Tsai was found by a construction crew as they arrived to work in her backyard. Heber Enoc Diaz, 27, is set to be arraigned Friday in connection with killing Tsai. The murder charge includes the special circumstance allegations of murder during the commission of a robbery and murder during the commission of a burglary.  Prosecutors have yet to decide whether to seek the death penalty against Diaz, who has been held without bail since he was arrested last Friday by Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies as he was leaving his home. The charges include allegations that he used a hammer, jab saw and box cutter in the commission of all but one of the crimes he's accused of committing a March 19 burglary. Tsai died from the \"combined effects of multiple sharp force injuries, multiple blunt trauma and asphyxia,\" according to coroner's records. Her 2005 Lexus RX 300, stolen from her home on the 300 block of East Forest Avenue, was recovered last Thursday night in the 900 block of Colorado Boulevard. Investigators arrested Diaz the following morning, as he was leaving his home, authorities disclosed.

{"story_id":38,"story_clean":"A  Bethlehem  man is accused of bringing a 14-year-old girl and a 15-year-old girl to his home where he plied them with drinks and had sex with them, according to a criminal complaint filed by city police Thursday. Bradley Larry Parker, 21, of 1849 Barbara St., was charged with statutory rape and corruption of minors and was committed to Northampton County Prison in lieu of $100,000 bail. According to the complaint, the incident happened in late August. Parker allegedly went to the Bushkill Township home of the 14-year-old where he picked both her and her 15-year-old friend up and took them to Bethlehem. It is not clear from the complaint how Parker knew the two teen-age girls. The complaint alleges that after they all went to Parker's home, he served the two girls alcoholic beverages and asked them both to have sex with him, which they did.

{"story_id":1046,"story_clean":"ENCINITAS, CA: Authorities sought the public's help Wednesday to identify and locate a man allegedly responsible for breaking into two cars, taking credit cards and then attempting to use the stolen cards. According to San Diego County Crime Stoppers and investigators from the North Coastal Sheriff's Station, the first vehicle burglary happened between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Friday in the 17000 block of Avenida Alondra in Rancho Santa Fe. A gym bag with two credit cards in it was allegedly\u00a0taken from a car that was locked but had the passenger window slightly open. A few hours later, just after 4 p.m., authorities said, a car was seen in surveillance video parking next to another car in front of Encinitas Country Day School in the 3300 block of Manchester Avenue in Encinitas. The window of the victim's car was open. A purse with a credit card and cash was allegedly taken. Later in the day, the man allegedly tried to use the credit cards at a business in the 1500 block of Encinitas Boulevard. Some of the transactions were canceled; some went through, authorities said.  The suspect was described as a 30- to 40\u2010year\u2010old white man between 5 feet 9 and 5 feet 11 inches tall and weighing between 140 and 160 pounds. He has a shaved head, a tan complexion and a thin build and was driving a four\u2010door, faded black Toyota Camry.

{"story_id":470,"story_clean":"A man who allegedly helped himself to a bag full of hair-care products without paying, and then threatened to harm the CVS employee who tried to stop him, has been arrested after he was recognized from surveillance video, authorities say. Montgomery County Police have charged Derrick Austin Bacon, 41, of the 3400 block of Castleleigh Road in Beltsville, for the  July 24 robbery of the CVS Pharmacy at 12209 Veirs Mill Road in Wheaton. About 10 a.m. on July 24, the suspect entered the CVS pharmacy carrying a duffle bag and went to the store's hair-care products display. A store employee reportedly saw Bacon stuff hair coloring and shampoo products inside his duffel bag. When the employee attempted to stop the shoplifter from leaving the store with the stolen merchandise, the suspect threatened to harm the employee, police say. The suspect was last seen fleeing on foot on Veirs Mill Road. Investigators posted a  surveillance video of the suspect  on Sept. 8 and asked for the public's help in identifying him. A Montgomery County Police officer recognized Bacon and identified him as the suspect in the video. Detectives obtained an arrest warrant for Bacon and arrested him at his home on Oct. 27. Bacon was taken to the Central Processing Unit, where he was charged with armed robbery, first-degree assault, and theft. Bacon was released after posting a $5,000 bond.

{"story_id":688,"story_clean":"A teacher, who also coaches a female youth hockey team, was behind bars today on suspicion of sexting a girl in South Orange County. Mark Falkowski of Long Beach, 38, who is a teacher at Magnolia Science Academy No. 3 in Carson, also coaches a female youth hockey team based in the Long Beach area, so investigators are concerned there might be more alleged victims, according to Orange County sheriff's Lt. Jeff Hallock. He added that the team draws members from throughout the Southland. Investigators did not want to release the name of the team. So far, Falkowski is not accused of molesting the girl, whose age was not released, but the investigation is ongoing, Hallock said. Falkowski is accused of sending sexually charged text and email messages to the girl beginning in early 2014. He was also accused of having inappropriate conversations via Skype. Falkowski was arrested Thursday afternoon after classes, Hallock said. The alleged inappropriate relationship began while the victim was living in south Orange County and continued when she moved out of state, Hallock said. Falkowski was being held in lieu of $100,000 bail. Anyone with information was asked to call investigators at (714) 647- 7060 or (714) 647-7000.

{"story_id":640,"story_clean":"A shoplifting suspect who pulled a knife on the manager of a Rite Aid here - and who is a suspect in other area crimes - was arrested recently.  Woodinville Police say that the suspect shoplifted from the Rite Aid here on Oct. 19. As the suspect tried to walk out of the store with a basket full of goods, police say, the manager tried to stop him. The suspect pulled out a knife and held it at his side, so the manager backed off. The suspect then fled in a vehicle with the stolen goods, police allege.  The suspect apparently committed similar crimes in Bothell and Bellevue. He was arrested by sheriff's deputies and Bellevue Police when he appeared at King County District Court on a different charge.

{"story_id":1159,"story_clean":"Jamal Calloway, a 21-year-old Powder Springs man, is accused of robbing a Dacula Chevron on Sunday. Calloway is charged with armed robbery, second-degree forgery and criminal attempt to commit a crime. He is being held at the Gwinnett County Detention Center without bond. According to police, the suspect entered the gas station shortly after 3 p.m. with a mask on and demanded money from the clerk. The suspect was reportedly armed with a black handgun and ordered the clerk to place the money in a see-through bag. The suspect allegedly asked for all the $100 bills saying, \"I'm gonna shoot you if you don't give me all of it. You're going to die for just this little bit.\" After the clerk filled the bag, the suspect ran out of the store, crossed the street and left the scene in a burgundy-colored car. A customer pulled into the parking lot as the suspect was leaving. After the clerk informed the customer about the robbery, the customer left to follow the suspect's vehicle. By the time police arrived at the Chevron, the customer had called 911 and advised he was still following the suspect.

{"story_id":801,"story_clean":"An Alpharetta woman is out on bond following an apparent road rage incident that left an SUV's passenger side door riddled with scratches. Roswell police on Saturday, Jan. 17 arrested Letty Amelia Bradford and charged her with criminal damage to property in the second degree and disrupting public school.  Roswell police on Dec. 19 were called to Hillside Elementary School at 9250 Scott Road in reference to a woman whose black 2014 Kia Sorento had been vandalized in school's parking lot. The victim pulled into the parking lot at the school during a Christmas program and was \"stuck behind the suspect for over a minute,\" Roswell police spokesperson Lisa Holland said.  \"When the suspect didn't move, she (the victim) went around her and parked in a parking space,\" Holland added.  When that occurred, the suspect allegedly \"jumped out of her car\" and began to yell at the woman for \"taking her parking space,\" Holland said.  After the confrontation, Holland said the suspect parked her vehicle, came back to the Kia Sorento and scratched its passenger side door. \"This was a road rage incident in a parking lot that went a little too far,\" Holland stated.  There was over $600 worth of damage to the vehicle, which Holland said\u00a0makes the charge a felony, as Georgia law classifies property damage over $500 as a felony. Bradford posted a $5,000 bond and was released on Monday from the Fulton County Jail.

{"story_id":161,"story_clean":"A 40-year-old Agoura Hills man is facing charges of making criminal threats against the Islamic Center of Southern California, Los Angeles police announced Tuesday. Mark Lucian Feigin allegedly called the mosque on Sept. 20 and threatened to kill a staff member, said Cmdr. Horace Frank, of the LAPD's Counter Terrorism and Special Operations Bureau. Police serving a search warrant on Feigin's home found a large cache of weapons -- some registered to the defendant -- plus thousands of rounds of ammunition and an illegally modified clip, Frank said. The suspect, who was arrested Wednesday, was charged by the state Attorney General's Office with a felony count of terrorist threats and a misdemeanor charge of placing annoying telephone calls. He posted $75,000 bail last week and was released, the officer said. Feigin is due to be arraigned in downtown Los Angeles on Nov. 10. Frank said Feigin \"crossed the line\" into illegal activity when he allegedly threatened the Islamic Center staffer. \"We recognize everyone has the right to free speech, but with that right comes enormous responsibility,\" Frank told reporters. \"When someone starts talking about, `I'll kill you,' it becomes a concern to us.\" City News Service; Photo courtesy of the LAPD","author_belief":56.2,"author_belief_highlight":[0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0],"suspect_committedCrime":90.6,"suspect_committedCrime_highlight":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

{"story_id":822,"story_clean":"An East Windsor man\u00a0was arrested early Wednesday morning after he allegedly poured gasoline on a Manchester house and attempted to light it on fire. Zachary Reddick, 24, of 6 First Street, was charged with first-degree criminal attempt to commit arson, four counts of first-degree reckless endangerment and third-degree criminal mischief. He is being held on $200,000 bond, and is scheduled to appear in Manchester Superior Court Thursday. In a written statement, Manchester Police Capt. Christopher Davis said officers were dispatched to 76 Devon Drive around 12:30 a.m. upon a report that an individual was seen pouring gasoline onto the residence before attempting to light it on fire.  The fire did not ignite, and the suspect then walked away, Davis said. Four people were inside the house at the time; there were no reported injuries, Davis said. Through investigation, police identified Reddick as the suspect, and arrested him without incident at his home, Davis said. \"At this point, the motive appears to be related to an earlier theft from the suspect while attending a get together at the victim's residence,\" Davis wrote.

{"story_id":1539,"story_clean":"The FBI announces the arrest of Robert Maurice Carlisle, aka \"Different, of Lithonia. Carlisle was taken into custody on a federal warrant for unlawful flight to avoid prosecution as a result of a tip from the public. He was wanted by the Gwinnett County Police Department on state warrants for two counts of Concealing the Death of Another, two counts of murder, and two counts of participating in criminal gang activity. Carlisle, 32, was arrested by the FBI's SWAT team with assistance from the DeKalb County Police Department at a residence in Stone Mountain, GA on the evening of Thursday, May 16, 2019. He was wanted in connection with the deaths of Derrick D. Ruff, 25 and Joshua L. Jackson, 25. Their bodies were found inside a storage unit at the Extra Space Storage located at 2040 Lawrenceville Highway in unincorporated Lawrenceville on Sunday, March 17, 2019. Both victims died from gunshot wounds. Ruff and Jackson were reported missing to the Athens-Clarke County PoliceDepartment last December. SEE ALSO:  New Suspect Named In Storage Space Double Homicide: Police 2 Gunshot-Riddled Bodies Found In Extra Space Storage Unit Carlisle is currently being held at the Gwinnett County jail. Further questions about the case should be directed to the Gwinnett County Police Department.  The FBI thanked the news media and the billboard campaign by the Outdoor Advertising Association of Georgia for their assistance as the tip that led to Carlisle's arrest was a direct result of the fugitive publicity they provided. The public should be reminded that the above are merely allegations and that all persons are to be considered innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.","author_belief":54.4,"author_belief_highlight":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.8,0.8,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6],"suspect_committedCrime":68.4,"suspect_committedCrime_highlight":[0.0,0.2,0.0222222222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.575,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.35,0.2,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4]}

{"story_id":153,"story_clean":"A 37-year-old man has been charged with robbing Chemical Bank in Grafton on Feb. 23. Matthew J. Kroffke allegedly used a gun to rob the bank before escaping in an SUV.  The robbery took place a little before 11 a.m. on Feb. 23. The FBI said at the time that an unidentified white man came into the bank brandishing a black handgun. He shouted for everyone to show him their hands. He then went to the bank manager's office, pointed his gun at her and told her to get out of her office. She followed him into the lobby of the bank. The man then told the three tellers at the bank to give him large bills. The suspect paced in front of the counter and counted backwards from 30. As he counted, he allegedly pointed his gun in the faces of the tellers and threatened to shoot them. The tellers handed over the cash and no one was hurt. The man then ran out of the bank and got into a blue Ford SUV and drove off. The suspected SUV was actually stopped by Grafton Police, but officers didn't yet have all the details related to the robbery. The driver of the car was identified as Kroffke, but he was released. That traffic stop was later brought to the attention of the FBI. The FBI arrested Kroffke in the Toledo-area on Feb. 28. The Department of Justice has now indicted Kroffke for the crime.

{"story_id":1674,"story_clean":"Three men have been arrested on suspicion of sexual crimes involving a 17-year-old boy after investigators allegedly obtained digital evidence from the victim's cellphone, Sausalito police announced Thursday.   The teenager's parents reportedly contacted police after man unknown to them had mailed the victim a teddy bear as a birthday present, police said. Investigators say that led them to Douglas Stevens of Jacksonville, Florida.  Stevens and the victim, who was 16 at the time, had allegedly exchanged videos of themselves masturbating and discussed meeting in Sausalito at a future date, according to police.  Information from the victim's cellphone was also used to identify two California residents, Kenneth Pierce of Sacramento and Jason Carbone of San Diego, as additional suspects, police said. Investigators say that explicit photos and videos had allegedly been exchanged between Carbone and the victim, police said.   Pierce and the victim also allegedly took photos and videos of themselves engaging in sex acts somewhere in Marin County, according to police. Pierce is a registered sex offender in Sacramento, police said.  The teen allegedly met the suspects on the social networking applications Kik and Instagram, police said.

{"story_id":1622,"story_clean":"The preliminary exam for a suspected robber from Chesterfield Township is scheduled Wednesday morning in New Baltimore. Marvin Lee Hopkins, 62, is charged with one count of armed robbery for the Sept. 27 holdup in the Kohl's parking lot off Gratiot near 23 Mile. Hopkins allegedly grabbed a 55-year-old female shopper by the arm as she put merchandise in her trunk. He is accused of threatening to kill her if she didn't hand over her purse while implying he had a weapon. The suspect then fled on foot, deploying multiple police officers and detectives to the area. Hopkins was arrested less than a week later following tips leading township authorities to a pair who found the discarded purse and then, ultimately, to Hopkins. He had been staying at the Chesterfield Motor Inn nearby the shopping plaza where the crime took place. Hopkins, a registered sex offender, has a record dating back to 1968 when he was convicted of assault with intent to rob while armed. He was then convicted of second-degree criminal sexual conduct in July 2010 in Macomb County, according to the Michigan Department of Corrections database. The preliminary exam is scheduled for 9 a.m. Wednesday in 42-2 District Court, according to court officials.

According to Tigard police spokesman Jim Wolf, a Washington County Grand Jury indicted Castle Mar. 10 for allegedly robbing an \"undisclosed amount of money\" from the Tigard Key Bank at 11665 S.W.

He is currently being held at the Washington County Jail on Southwest Adams Avenue in Hillsboro.

{"story_id":104,"story_clean":"A 26-year-old Parsippany man has been charged with burglarizing the local Wendy's by smashing the drive-through window with a concrete block, police said. Quincy Penn allegedly burglarized the Wendy's at 2099 Route 46 around 3:3:0 a.m. on June 19.  Parsippany officers responded to the restaurant after the burglar alarm was activated.

{"story_id":1446,"story_clean":"Quick police work on Thursday and the unique quality of an armed robbery suspect's voice helped officers track down two alleged robbers within minutes of the crime. The attempted robbery went down around 10:30 p.m. behind Menchie's, a frozen yogurt shop located in the Belle Hall Shopping Center, according to a police incident report. A teenage worker at the shop was taking out trash for the evening when he was apparently attacked from behind, the report states. The victim told officers one man put him in a choke hold and held a knife to his neck as a second suspect approached. Though the alleged victim couldn't provide a physical description of the suspects, he told officers that one of the robbers sounded like DeVaughn Unique Green, an employee fired from the yogurt shop just a few days before the robbery. The suspects fled the scene, and no money was taken. The victim said he thought the men were trying to enter the business to commit a robbery. Officers began patrolling the area and soon heard someone running through the woods near Seacoast Church. They arrested one suspect, Luke Carpenter, 19, on armed robbery charges. He was covered in grass and was breathing heavily the report states. Officers later spotted a woman leaving Carpenter's home. She said she was headed to pick up Carpenter and another man named DeVaughn. She said Carpenter had called, breathing heavily, needing a ride home. Officers don't say in their initial reports how they tracked down DeVaughn Green, 19, but arrest records show the teenage suspect was arrested with Carpenter and charged with armed robbery.

{"story_id":1444,"story_clean":"pushing doctor in Monroe, NY adds a new dimension to the case of a wide-ranging Hudson Valley opiod drug ring. The case blew open after a teacher died in 2015 from an overdose of oxycodone and alprazolam, and authorities alleged his death was connected with an operation run by a doctor who wrote thousands of medically unnecessary and phony prescriptions for painkillers, and a confederate who sold them. \"Unscrupulous healthcare professionals like Doctor Alfred Ramirez, who is alleged to have prescribed over 10,000 medically unnecessary oxycodone pills over a four-year period, and his alleged distributor, James Cooney, fuel this epidemic of poison by prescription,\" said U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in 2015. The teacher was a Yonkers resident, as was the accused seller. The accused doc, a psychiatrist with a practice in Orange and Dutchess counties. The long list of investigating law enforcement agencies included the Westchester County Police Department, the Town of Orangetown Police Department, the Town of Woodbury Police Department and the Westchester County Department of Public Safety. Oxycodone is a prescription-strength Schedule II narcotic used to treat severe and chronic pain conditions. Oxycodone can result in addiction similar to an addiction to codeine or morphine, and there is a massive illegal market for oxycodone. Heroin has become a cheaper substitute.

{"story_id":587,"story_clean":"A racial profiling complaint has led to the arrest of the Storrs woman who made the accusation against a Connecticut State Trooper. According to a statement issued by state police, a trooper conducted a motor vehicle stop on Route 5\/15 in Wethersfield on May 9. As a result of the motor vehicle stop, the operator was issued an infraction for Unsafe Lane Change.  Following the incident, the driver wrote a complaint letter to the Commissioner of the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection (DESPP) alleging she was stopped and issued the infraction based upon the illegal practice of racial profiling. To sign up for breaking Mansfield and Storrs news alerts and more, click here.  The Connecticut State Police Internal Affairs office investigated the allegations against the trooper and concluded that statements provided by the accused were false and the Trooper was exonerated on all charges.  Based upon the nature of the complaint, a criminal investigation was initiated into the operator's allegations and an arrest warrant was applied for and granted by the Hartford Superior Court. At about 10:15 a.m. Tuesday, the driver, identified as Minati Roychoudhuri, of Fieldstone Drive, Storrs, surrendered at Troop H-Hartford on an arrest warrant charging her with second-degree false statement.  Roychoudhuri was released after posting $1,000 bond. She is scheduled to appear Aug 14 in state Superior Court in Hartford.","author_belief":48.6666666667,"author_belief_highlight":[0.0,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.5,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1111111111,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.3333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667],"suspect_committedCrime":63.6666666667,"suspect_committedCrime_highlight":[0.0,0.1388888889,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.0,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.4814814815,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.3333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667]}
{"story_id":1614,"story_clean":"The owner of a Mission Viejo massage business was arrested on suspicion of sexually assaulting a female customer, and investigators believe there are additional alleged victims, a sheriff's lieutenant said Friday. Qing Dai, 40, of Mission Viejo, who owns Sunny's Massage at 24000 Alicia Parkway, No. 32, was taken into custody Thursday and booked on suspicion of one count of sexual battery, according to Orange County sheriff's Lt. Lane Lagaret. Prosecutors have received evidence related to three more alleged victims, so Dai could face further charges, he said. A 37-year-old woman came forward to sheriff's deputies on May 16, claiming she was sexually assaulted at the business, Lagaret said. On June 15, a 32-year-old woman made the same allegation, he said. Two other female customers previously alleged they were assaulted at the business, Lagaret said, but he did not have dates of those alleged incidents. Dai posted bail Thursday and was released, according to jail records.

{"story_id":1144,"story_clean":"In the second anti-Muslim attack reported in New York City on Wednesday, Sept. 13, an unidentified suspect (pictured above) made \"anti-Muslim remarks\" to a 53-year-old man near the Dekalb Avenue L train station, then \"slapped the victim's cellphone from his hand\" and \"punched him one time to the left side of his neck,\" according to the NYPD. The attack was carried out in broad daylight, around 8:30 a.m., police said, on the busy corner of  Wyckoff Avenue and Stockholm Street . Just a few hours later, at another subway stop in Forest Hills, Queens, a pair of Orthodox Jewish women were  brutally beaten  by a man who mistook them for Muslims and told them to go back to their \"f---ing country,\" according to the Queens District Attorney. Dimitrios Zias, 40, was arrested soon after. (\"Is it because I'm rich and white?\" he allegedly told his arresting officers.) A total of 214 hate crimes were reported across NYC during the first six months of 2017, police data  shows . Of those, 25 were anti-Muslim or anti-Arab. An NYPD spokeswoman could not provide any details on what kind of anti-Muslim comments, exactly, were made in the Bushwick assault. Cops have yet to arrest anyone for the early-morning attack. However, this is the guy they're looking for: Police described the suspect as \"a male with long hair and last seen wearing sandals with white socks and a black 'True Religion' t-shirt.\" Recognize him? You can tell police what you know  online  or via the NYPD tip line, at 1-800-577-8477.

{"story_id":1723,"story_clean":"Two men face several charges after being uncooperative during a DWI arrest, with one of the men accused of spitting on police officers, Washington Township police said.  Donald Phillips, 41, of Hickory, North Carolina, and Daniel Davinci, 32, of Hackettstown, both face several charges stemming from an early-morning incident on Dec. 31. Police say the men were stopped in front of the Schooleys Mountain Fire House with a flat fire around 1 a.m. when police found them. Phillips, who police say was driving, allegedly smelled like alcohol and refused to answer any questions. Police asked him to complete field sobriety tests, and he allegedly refused. He was placed under arrest and taken to police headquarters. Davinci, the passenger, was also arrested for an active warrant. Police say he spit \"all over\" the inside of the police car while being taken to headquarters, and continued to spit at officers during processing. Davinci is accused of kicking the inside of the patrol car doors while being transferred to the Morris County Correctional Facility to be picked up by Monmouth County authorities; police say they placed him in leg restraints. Phillips was charged with DWI, refusal to provide breath samples and reckless driving. Davinci was charged with criminal mischief and resisting arrest.

{"story_id":1123,"story_clean":"Hoboken police arrested a local man after he allegedly cut himself and generated a false police report, then blamed the incident on a \"misidentified person,\" authorities say. According to the Hoboken Police Department, officers originally responded to the scene of an alleged stabbing near Third and Monroe streets around 10:50 a.m. on Aug. 22. On arrival, the officers found a man walking in the area with what appeared to be slash wounds to his left triceps and rib area. The man gave a formal statement that identified his alleged assailant, which eventually led officers to issue an arrest warrant for the accused person, authorities said. There was just one problem, according to police; the information was \"false.\" Hoboken police had this to say about the incident: On Thursday, police arrested the man who gave the false report, Robert Negron-Soto, 52, of Hoboken, and charged him with providing a false report to law enforcement authorities, a fourth-degree crime. \"Negron-Soto cooperated with detectives and provided a full statement confirming that he provided false information implicating an innocent person,\" Hoboken police stated. \"Negron-Soto went on to say that the wounds were self-inflicted and he did so because of personal reasons.\" Keep updated with local public safety alerts at the Patch Hoboken Facebook page.

Member of the Region 3 Metro Tactical Unit arrested David Cardenas, 22, for a home invasion robbery that occurred on May 22 along the 700 block of Longspur Boulevard. Police said Cardenas also was charged with a subsequent home invasion on May 24 along the 1500 block of West Braker Lane.  In the earlier home invasion, Cardenas is accused of kicking in the door of an apartment while its occupants were sleeping inside. A woman inside the apartment was awakened by the home invasion before Cardenas allegedly threatened her while demanding valuables and then fleeing the scene. The woman and other occupants were uninjured, police said.  In their search for the suspect, the Austin Police Department previously released surveillance camera footage showing Cardenas approaching the apartment unit before scurrying off.","author_belief":88.8571428571,"author_belief_highlight":[0.7142857143,0.7142857143,0.7142857143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1428571429,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429],"suspect_committedCrime":87.0,"suspect_committedCrime_highlight":[0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.1428571429,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.0,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.2857142857,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857]}

At approximately 11:30 p.m. July 25, a tenant in the notified police that someone was breaking into the machines in the communal laundry room. When an officer responded to the complex and opened the door, he found a man sitting on the laundry room floor with the dryer upside down between his legs. He appeared to be working on the machine, the report stated. Police ordered the man to the ground, placed him in handcuffs and found a small tool in his pocket. When asked what he was doing, the suspect said, \"Someone showed me how to get the coins out of the machine. You know times are tough right now,\" police said.

{"story_id":1638,"story_clean":"The suspect in a deadly shooting in  Cedar Park earlier this month is said to have confessed to the crime on Facebook, according to published reports.  Referencing an arrest affidavit, Jose Loza, 26, is accused of fatally shooting Fernando Lopez, 22, as the victim and his uncle sat in a car at the corner of 183A and East Whitestone Boulevard at around 6 a.m., CBS Austin reported. The older man was hospitalized for medical treatment of gunshot wounds.  Prior to the killing, according to the report, Lopez feared for his life after multiple threats from the suspect. The reason for Loza's ire was that Lopez had texted the suspect's ex-girlfriend, according to the report.

{"story_id":1061,"story_clean":"first as an actual employee, then as an impostor. Police say that 28-year-old Aaron Alexander Holmes was fired from the Burnsville Walmart in mid-March. Nevertheless, on April 28 he allegedly donned the standard Walmart uniform\u2014a blue shirt and khaki pants, complete with name tag\u2014and headed to the store. Once inside, he approached an employee who was \"very busy\" and tricked them into giving him a walkie-talkie and a set of keys. Holmes quickly made off with three Apple iPads, collectively valued at $1,697. The next day, Holmes appeared at the store again and took three more iPads while an accomplice distracted the staff. On his way out, he was confronted by Walmart employees, but managed to get away before police arrived. Store management positively identified the suspect seen on surveillance as Holmes. According to the criminal complaint, the six stolen iPads are just the tip of the iceberg. A search of pawn store records revealed that Holmes sold 56 high value electronic items from Nov. 3, 2012 through April 24, 2013. The total retail value of the pawned items and the six missing tops $20,000. Holmes has been charged with receiving stolen property, a felony with a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $20,000 fine. He remains in custody at the Dakota County Jail, held on a $30,000 bond. The bond will be reduced to $15,000 if Holmes agrees to abide by the court's conditions, among them: Stay away from the Walmart.\u00a0 His next court appearance is scheduled for June 4.

{"story_id":453,"story_clean":"A man wanted in Saturday's  smash-and-grab robbery at a Novi jewelry store  surrendered to Detroit police Monday night, but apparently had second thoughts: He allegedly bit and scratched a police officer and kicked out the backseat windows of a police cruiser, according to media reports. Two other suspects in the robbery, which resulted in the lockdown and evacuation of Twelve Oaks Mall after an erroneous tweet warned of an active shooter, remain at large. Novi police released  surveillance photos of the suspects  inside Tapper's jewelry store on Monday. Detroit Police Sgt. Michael Woody told the Detroit Free Press the suspect, a 26-year-old Detroit man, arrived with a family member at the 6th Precinct about 10 p.m., but when Novi police arrived to pick him up, he tried to escape on foot.  Officers caught up with him, but in the process,  one Novi officer was bitten , Novi police Sgt. Scott Baetens told the Free Press. After the suspect, whose name hasn't been released, was placed in the squad car, he  kicked out two windows  in the back seat, WXYZ-TV reported. The suspect is one of three men accused of using a small hammer to smash a jewelry display case at Tapper's and stealing two luxury watches about 5:20 p.m. Saturday. The noise from the shattering glass sounded like a gunshot, resulting in mass panic at the mall. This is the  second smash-and-grab at Tapper's this year , police told WJBK-TV. Police believe they're part of a known crime-ring operating in southeast Michigan, according to WXYZ-TV. Anyone who recognizes the suspects is encouraged to contact Det. Sgt.

{"story_id":254,"story_clean":"A Colorado ex-con accused of kidnapping a 21-year-old German exchange student in Pacific Beach on New Year's Day and raping her at knifepoint in his truck must stand trial on felony charges, a judge ruled Thursday. Jacob Paul Skorniak, 50, is charged with forcible rape and kidnapping for rape. He faces 65 years to life in prison if convicted. At his arraignment in January, Deputy District Attorney Marisa Di Tillio said that the victim was attacked as she exited a taxi cab and tried to make her way home. Skorniak, a total stranger to the victim, used a knife to cut off some of her clothing before raping her, the prosecutor alleged. During the struggle, the victim's cell phone dialed a family member, who was able to hear some of the violence, Di Tillio told the judge. The prosecutor alleged that Skorniak released the victim a couple of blocks from the place she was staying after seeing police surrounding the residence. The defendant was the subject of a statewide search until he was arrested Jan. 21 in Santa Barbara. Di Tillio said Skorniak has a significant criminal history dating back to the 1980s, including convictions for burglary, robbery and escape. Skorniak was also on federal parole at the time of the alleged rape, the prosecutor said. Judge Louis Hanoian found that enough evidence was presented at the preliminary hearing, for the defendant to proceed to trial. He set a Dec. 1 readiness conference and April 7 trial date. - City News Service \/ Image via Shutterstock","author_belief":72.0,"author_belief_highlight":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.1666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0],"suspect_committedCrime":96.4,"suspect_committedCrime_highlight":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7333333333,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.6,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

{"story_id":897,"story_clean":"Authorities have arrested a Lake County woman for her alleged role in a home invasion that occurred during the early morning hours of May 21, authorities said. Laura R. Townsend, 22, of the 10700 block of West 17th Street in Benton Township was taken into custody Tuesday at her home after authorities obtained a warrant for her arrest on charges of home invasion, a class X felony; and residential burglary, a Class 1 felony. Police believe Townsend is one of three people involved in the May 21 home invasion at a residence in the 18500 block of West Main Street in Warren Township. The Lake County Sheriff's Office was called to the home at about 1 a.m. When deputies arrived, they learned three suspects robbed three people at the home of their cell phones, according to the news release. Two of the suspects were armed with handguns. Police said one of the male suspects also struck one of the residents in the face with a firearm. The victim's injuries did not require hospitalization. Two of the offenders were described as being white or Hispanic males, both approximately 5-feet, 5-inches tall in their late 20s or early 30s. One of the offenders was described as being a white or Hispanic female in her 20s. During the investigation, sheriff's office detectives determined one of the suspects involved in the home invasion was Townsend, according to authorities.

Patrick Wehrung, 25, was taken into custody during a traffic stop on Tuesday, the same day the parents of the 15-year-old reported the alleged crimes, according to San Diego police. The girl told investigators she had been involved in a sexual relationship with Wehrung for several months, Lt. Sandra Albrektsen said. The teen reported that he had picked her up at her home on several occasions and taken her to La Jolla Shores Beach, where the sex acts allegedly occurred. The teenager had taken classes from Wehrung at Champion Gymnastics & Cheer on Prospect Avenue, where the suspect was employed until this week. The owner of the business fired Wehrung upon learning of the accusations against him, police said.

{"story_id":346,"story_clean":"A Hemet man accused of shooting his girlfriend and attempting to shoot a police officer who tried to arrest him moments later was charged Thursday with two counts of attempted murder. Kevin Lorell Carter, 39, was arrested Monday after the alleged attack in the 600 block of Florida Avenue, near Tahquitz Avenue. Along with the attempted murder counts, Carter is charged with domestic abuse, as well as sentence-enhancing gun and great bodily injury allegations. He's being held in lieu of $2 million bail at the Smith Correctional Facility in Banning and is slated to make his initial court appearance Thursday afternoon at the Banning Justice Center. According to Hemet police Lt. Jeff Davis, Carter allegedly shot the woman, whose name was not released, several times in the upper body during an argument shortly before 5 a.m. Monday. Patrol officers arrived within a couple of minutes and found the victim wounded, but the defendant's whereabouts were initially unclear, Davis said. He said a patrolman spotted Carter about a block away and attempted to detain him, but the suspect allegedly \"pulled a firearm and shot at the officer.\" The lawman did not return fire, according to the lieutenant. Carter then fled, trying to hide on Palm Avenue, where officers located him and took him into custody without further trouble, Davis said. The gunshot victim was taken to a trauma center for treatment. She's expected to recover, according to Davis. Carter has no prior documented felony convictions in Riverside County. \u2014 By City News Service \/ Patch file photo by Renee Schiavone","author_belief":null,"author_belief_highlight":null,"suspect_committedCrime":95.2,"suspect_committedCrime_highlight":[0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

On Wednesday, Glen Ridge police announced that its detectives charged Rathny Barquero, 22, of Caldwell, with burglary, criminal mischief and theft in connection with the Dec. 13 incident.

{"story_id":263,"story_clean":"A Cook County judge increased bail for a Park Forest man accused of throwing a pipe and biting a police officer during a traffic stop in Evergreen Park. Travis Lacefield, 63, appeared before Judge John Mahoney on felony charges of aggravated battery to a police officer and possession of a controlled substance. Lacefield also ate some cocaine, the prosecutor said. Around 3 p.m. Sept. 6, Evergreen Park police officers stopped Lacefield at 91st Street and Western Avenue. Officers said they observed a pipe in plain view on the vehicle's center console. When asked about the pipe, Lacefield threw it at the police officer, the prosecutor said. Lacefield allegedly refused to step out of his vehicle. Officers reached into the vehicle as Lacefield continued to reach into the center console, when the prosecutor said Lacefield bit the officer's wrist breaking the skin. Police said Lacefield ate the suspected cocaine in front of the officers. The officer was treated at Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn.  Lacefield's attorney told the judge that his client has neuropathy. The attorney also said that police tased Lacefield. \"I don't think he is intended to bite the officer,\" the attorney said. \"Where did he intend to bite him,\" Mahoney asked. The attorney said the hospital took \"vials of blood\" from Lacefield, who tested negative for HIV and hepatitis.

{"story_id":1439,"story_clean":"Port Authority officers apprehended an Irvington man with three active criminal warrants out of Millburn at the Journal Square PATH station on Wednesday after he allegedly stole a commuter's cell phone, led police on a chase down the tracks and hid under a train, authorities say. According to the Port Authority of NY\/NJ, officers conducting bag checks at the station heard a loud disturbance coming from the direction of Track 3 around 8:10 a.m. On arrival at the scene, a 51-year-old Roselle Park woman and other witnesses pointed to a man running east down the train tracks and stated that he just stole the woman's phone. After having workers shut off power, the Port Authority officers \u2013 soon joined by several of their counterparts - pursued the suspect east onto the tracks. The officers soon found the suspect \u2013 later identified as Yuri McCoy, 20, of Irvington \u2013 hiding under a train, authorities said. Police found McCoy in possession of a knife and the victim's cell phone, authorities said. Officers arrested McCoy without further incident. Power was resumed after 16 minutes of being shut off, authorities stated. Police charged McCoy with Theft, Obstructing the Admin of Law, Resisting Arrest, Interference with Transportation and Possession of a Weapon for Unlawful Purpose. He was also found to have four active criminal warrants, including three in Millburn and one in Woodbridge, authorities said.

{"story_id":151,"story_clean":"A 36-year-old West Warwick, Rhode Island man was arrested on a charge of second-degree criminal mischief on Aug. 8 after he allegedly threw a brick through the window of the Darien Trader Joe's on the Post Road, according to police. Officers were dispatched to the scene at about 1:25 a.m. after a report of breaking glass.  \"Arriving Officers observed a small hole in one of the front windows of Trader Joe's, and a brick just inside the window,\" wrote police in a statement. \"The remainder of the store was checked, and no damage was found. A check of the area revealed a suspect, later identified as Charles Taylor. Video footage was obtained from the adjacent Chase Bank which showed an individual, believed to be Taylor, walking towards the front of Trader Joe's with a brick in his hand.\" Taylor \"wouldn't admit to breaking the window, but offered to pay for it,\" said police, and he told officers \"that he was in need of medical attention\" and was transported to Norwalk Hospital by Post 53.  He was issued a misdemeanor summons and was released him on a promise to appear in Stamford Superior Court on Aug. 18.

{"story_id":473,"story_clean":"A man who allegedly robbed a bank in Cerritos today, leaving behind what he claimed was a bomb, was arrested by deputies about two hours after the crime was reported, authorities said. Patrol units were notified about 9:25 a.m. of the robbery in the 11300 block of South Street, Lt. Martin Rodriguez of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Major Crimes Bureau said. Upon arrival, deputies learned the suspect, described as a man in his 40s, entered the bank and demanded money. The bank robber also claimed to have an explosive device in a plastic bag, Rodriguez said. He was handed \"a moderate amount of cash\" and left the purported bomb inside the bank along a row of teller windows, the lieutenant said. Deputies evacuated the bank and called in the Arson\/Explosives Detail, which determined the item was \"merely fashioned to resemble an explosive device,\" Rodriguez said. \"Deputies discovered a man matching the description of the suspect was seen acting suspiciously and attempting to conceal himself on the premises of a nearby automotive repair business in Cerritos,\" Rodriguez said. The suspect was arrested, about two hours after the robbery was reported, in the area of 195th Street and Pioneer Boulevard, according to Rodriguez, who said the man was identified by witnesses and was also found to have currency that numerically matched cash taken from the bank. The man, whose name was not released, was arrested and booked on suspicion of armed bank robbery, making criminal threats and a bomb threat, Rodriguez said. Bail has been set at $100,000. The suspect's name was not released because investigators are looking into other additional robberies that he may have committed, Rodriguez said.

{"story_id":1804,"story_clean":"Watertown Police arrested a 26-year-old Belmont man after he tried to push in a door of a home on Downey Street in Watertown in the early hours of Sunday, Oct. 9. Michael James Boutin of 43 Burnham St., Apt. C2 in Belmont, faces a slew of charges after a night of allegedly breaking into cars and a house, said Watertown Police Lt. Michael Lawn. The arrest comes as many communities in eastern Massachusetts have seen a marked increase in breaking and entering and robbery crimes. In Billerica, police went so far as to issue a reverse 911 announcement for residents to keep doors and windows locked after a rash of burglaries.

{"story_id":929,"story_clean":"Bloomfield police have arrested a man suspected of assaulting his ex-girlfriend, smashing her car window and pulling a gun on her as she tried to escape, authorities said. On Wednesday, Bloomfield officers and agents from the FBI Fugitive Task Force located and apprehended Alkariem Little, 23, in a Newark basement without incident, authorities said. According to the Bloomfield Police Department, Little is accused of attacking his former girlfriend as she was walking to her car from the Bloomfield College library. The victim managed to lock herself in the car and eventually drive away, but not before Little allegedly tried to force his way inside, smashed the window and pulled a gun from his waistband. Bloomfield police immediately entered Little as a \"wanted person\" and issued a warrant for his arrest on charges including aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, receiving stolen property and criminal mischief. Bloomfield police said that Little has a criminal history including a warrant from the Orange Police Department for attempted murder. Bloomfield detectives coordinated with the police departments in Elizabeth and Union County to find Little. Keep updated with local public safety alerts at the Patch Bloomfield Facebook page.

{"story_id":489,"story_clean":"A man with an apparent penchant for robbing U.S. Banks in Washington County was arrested Monday in Aloha after he allegedly robbed another U.S. Bank branch.  Brandon Ross Linder, 32, was taken to Washington County Jail. He is being held on probation violations stemming from a 2016 assault conviction. The bank robbery charge will be handled by the FBI.  According to the Washington County Sheriff's Office, Linder visited the U.S. Bank at 19091 S.W. Tualatin Valley Highway around 2:15 p.m. Sept. 10. Approaching the counter, Linder passed a note demanding money to a teller. Taking an undisclosed amount of cash, he fled on foot, sheriff's officials said. Deputies quickly began searching the area near the bank for someone matching the description provided by witnesses and located a man they believed was the suspect \u2014 later identified as Linder \u2014 at a nearby shopping center. Linder was arrested without additional incident.  In its statement, sheriff's officials noted Linder's previous U.S. Bank robbery conviction from 2009 in Beaverton.

{"story_id":1652,"story_clean":"There may have been more than massages happening inside a home in Atascocita. On Wednesday, deputy constables arrested a 54-year-old woman they say was running an illegal massage parlor and a suspected brothel out of her home. Harris County Precinct 4 Constable Mark Herman said in a press release that investigators in his office had received several complaints about a spike in traffic at a home in the 7200 block of Lonesome Woods Trail. Investigators launched an under cover operation and investigators discovered Nancy Camacho was operating an illicit massage parlor out of her home.  Undercover investigators spoke with some of the clients, who gave written statements to police alleging lot more than massages were taking place in the home.  According to investigators, there was enough evidence collected that indicated illicit activities were taking place inside the home which violated the Harris County Sexually Oriented Business Regulations. \"These type of businesses, either as a store front or in a neighborhood, have been proven to bring additional crime into the area,\" Herman said. \"This one is especially troubling due to its close proximity to Atascocita Middle School and the hours of operation coinciding with the kids walking to and from school in front of the residence.\" Camacho was arrested, charged with operating a massage parlor without a license and booked into the Harris County Jail.

{"story_id":1172,"story_clean":"King County detectives are looking for a man suspected of committing over 100 car prowls in northeast King County and southeast Snohomish County.  Police have served warrants on Hugh \"Pat\" P. Doherty's home and car, but haven't located him yet. They believe he is being hidden by acquaintances. According to police, Doherty has a long criminal history with nine felony, 10 gross misdemeanor, and two misdemeanor convictions.  Doherty is wanted on two counts of eluding, 18 counts of vehicle prowl, one count of theft, two counts of identity theft, one count of resisting arrest, and one count of reckless driving. He also has a felony warrant for escape and eluding.  According to reports , Doherty has targeted cars parked at schools and churches in the area. In one incident, Doherty allegedly broke into a car and stole a purse while a young girl was inside. That incident happened at the Goddard School in Redmond.  Doherty, 38, is about 6 feet tall with a thin, athletic build. He is described as having \"sunken cheeks\" and often alters his facial hair.  King County Sheriff's Det.

{"story_id":147,"story_clean":"A 35-year-old Solano County man is out on bail after his arrest Oct. 31 on suspicion of pimping and pandering in Napa County, according to the Napa Special Investigations Bureau. Harold Domingue II, 35, of Suisun City, was arrested in an undercover operation which involved detectives responding to an online ad that offered prostitution services in the county, NSIB Lt. Gary Pitkin said in a news release Tuesday. Pitkin said NSIB had been looking into suspected sex trafficking activities being offered in Napa County via the internet. Detectives began communicating with the ad holder, ultimately setting up a meeting for the purpose of prostitution in the city of Napa on Halloween, Pitkin said.  \"As the investigation progressed, detectives conducted surveillance which aided them in identifying the prostitute and her pimp,\" Pitkin said. The suspected prostitute and her alleged pimp, Domingue, were detained in the 200 block of S. Coombs Street in Napa.  Domingue was arrested and booked into Napa County jail, but has since been released on $10,000 bail, Pitkin said.  Following his arrest, detectives obtained a search warrant, which they used to recover additional evidence of his alleged sex trafficking, the lieutenant said.

{"story_id":1753,"story_clean":"Two people were arrested for allegedly stealing a rental car found Wednesday outside a Walmart store in Milpitas, where officers found items that suggested the pair committed identity theft, police said.  Sandra Dian Oliveira, 39, of Castro Valley, and Noah Forrest Kerran, 34, of South San Francisco, were arrested on suspicion of car theft, possession of a stolen vehicle, and identity theft, police Sgt. Matthew  Miller said. An officer saw a rented silver 2015 Kia Optima parked outside a Walmart Supercenter store at 301 Ranch Drive, just west of Interstate Highway 880, shortly after 6 a.m. Wednesday, Miller said. The officer ran a check on the license plate and learned the Alameda County Sheriff's Office reported the car stolen on July 5, according to Miller. More officers responded to the scene to monitor the car and took the suspects into custody as they returned to the vehicle, Miller said. Kerran allegedly had the car key and drug paraphernalia, according to Miller.

The Campbell Police Department recommends averting this crime by painting a valve to decrease its value, place in a protective cage, post warnings, consider using a plastic coating or disguise the device within the environment. -- Image via Shutterstock","author_belief":70.3333333333,"author_belief_highlight":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0],"suspect_committedCrime":79.1666666667,"suspect_committedCrime_highlight":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}
{"story_id":464,"story_clean":"A man was hospitalized Sunday in Metro Denver after a multi-hour crime spree that featured a carjacking, police chase, two robberies and gobbling down fistfuls of narcotics. Jefferson Co. Sheriff's deputies announced the arrest of the unidentified man Saturday morning, saying the suspect allegedly started the morning at 4 a.m. by holding a Lakewood driver at gunpoint and demanding his red Nissan near Morrison Road and South Kipling Parkway. The carjacking victim reportedly  convinced the suspect to drop him at work  -- and keep the car, Jefferson County Sheriff's Office spokesman Marc Techmeyer told Channel 7.  \"Look, man, I just want to go to work. Drop me at work and you can keep my car,\" Techmeyer said, quoting the victim, who was dropped off at a gas station and called 911, Techmeyer said. Around 9 a.m., the suspect allegedly robbed a CVS pharmacy in Littleton, demanding narcotics, and then around 11 a.m. allegedly robbed the Littleton branch Bank of the West at Kipling Parkway. He then allegedly broke into a home near Ken Caryl and attempted to steal another car.  When officers from the Lakewood, Littleton , Jefferson Co. Sheriff and Colorado State Patrol curbed the car, the suspect allegedly ingested handfuls of pills stolen from CVS, and then had to be taken to a hospital, Techmeyer told Channel 7. The suspect will likely face multiple charges, including kidnapping, robbery and home invasion.  See the Channel 7 Report here.

{"story_id":187,"story_clean":"A 52-year-old man accused of fatally stabbing an acquaintance whose body turned up in an East County field nearly 31 years ago is scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday at the courthouse in El Cajon. Stacy Rafel Littleton of San Diego was re-booked on a murder charge Monday, shortly after being arrested in La Mesa for alleged controlled substance offenses, according to sheriff's officials. Littleton is suspected of murdering 20-year-old Cyrus Jefferson, who was found dead in an empty lot in the 2500 block of 69th Street in Lemon Grove on Oct. 11, 1986, homicide Lt. Kenneth Nelson said. Investigators determined that Littleton and Jefferson had been together that day, driving around in the victim's car, according to Nelson. Authorities later tracked down the vehicle in the East County, he said. Detectives soon arrested Littleton on suspicion of killing Jefferson, but the county District Attorney's Office ultimately declined to file charges against him, citing insufficient evidence. Recently, sheriff's cold-case investigators reopened the case. \"With advancement in technology and DNA-testing techniques, evidence collected at the original crime scene was re-evaluated,\" the lieutenant said. \"A DNA profile belonging to Littleton was identified.\" Nelson did not specify the nature of that alleged evidence. Authorities remain uncertain about the motive for the slaying, he said. Littleton was being held at San Diego Central Jail in lieu of $1 million bail pending arraignment.

Saline Police were able to locate him in Los Angeles and he was extradited to Michigan and lodged at the Washtenaw County Jail, according to police. Police began investigating Sandig when another man discovered a bank account and credit cards were opened in his name. The alleged victim suspected Sandig because he had access to personal information because both men were trying to obtain medical marijuana cards through the same person. Sandig kept a copy of the man's application form and used the information to open bank accounts and three credit cards that were quickly maxed out before they were trashed, according to police reports.","author_belief":68.8333333333,"author_belief_highlight":[0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1666666667,0.7777777778,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667],"suspect_committedCrime":86.6666666667,"suspect_committedCrime_highlight":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.5,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333

{"story_id":144,"story_clean":"A 35-year-old man was arrested Monday on accusations he killed his mother after dropping her off last Thursday afternoon at the hospital where she was placed on life support and officers responded, the San Jose Police Department reported.  Officers were told the victim identified as Cynthia Mykkanen, 57, would probably not survive. She was taken off life support and pronounced dead Monday.  A follow up investigation by homicide detectives determined the suspect identified as Ryan Garner, the victim's son, as the person responsible for the assault. The investigation revealed that the suspect assaulted the victim inside their residence on the 3300 block of Cortese Circle in San Jose.  The suspect drove the victim to the Regional Medical Center where he dropped her off then fled prior to police arrival. Later that night, the suspect was located driving his vehicle on U.S. Highway 101 at Blossom Hill Road in San Jose where he was apprehended by a police K9 and taken into custody. The suspect was taken to a local hospital for injuries sustained from a dog bite and booked into Santa Clara County Jail initially on attempted murder allegations. His booking charges have since been upgraded to murder since the woman died.  This is the city's 21st homicide of 2019.

{"story_id":752,"story_clean":"A youth pastor at an Aliso Viejo church was behind bars today for allegedly having \"inappropriate\" contact with children, sometimes on church property. Brandon McDade, 30, of Mission Viejo, was arrested Wednesday and is being held in lieu of $20,000 bail, according to the Orange County Sheriff's Department. It the second time in a month that a South County youth pastor has been arrested on suspicion of  sexually assaulting congregants . Sheriff's officials said they began investigating McDade Monday after receiving a report of inappropriate conduct. While investigating, detectives contacted several other alleged victims, each of whom indicated there had been inappropriate conduct by McDade over a two-year period when he worked as a youth pastor at Grace Hills Church, according to the sheriff's department. \"There have been several alleged incidents of lewd and inappropriate conduct, several of which have occurred on the church property,\" said Lt. Jeff Hallock, a spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department. \"The teenage victims all attended Grace Hills Church and were part of the youth group when the lewd acts occurred. McDade has been employed by the church for approximately six years. Based on the allegations, McDade's leadership role and access to children, investigators believe there are additional victims.\" Anyone with information was asked to call the sheriff's department at (714) 647- 7418 or (714) 647-7000. Anonymous tips can be made to Orange County Crimestoppers at (855) 847-6227 or occrimestoppers.org. In a similar case last month at a Lake Forest church, a  youth pastor from Aliso Viejo was accused of raping or assaulting multiple teens and young women .

{"story_id":1535,"story_clean":"The East Lyme Police Department is currently reminding residents to secure their doors and windows, and to lock their vehicles. Residents should also watch over their neighborhoods and report any suspicious activity to the police, according to a release. The warning comes due to reports of a recently released prisoner possibly reverting back to crime immediately. The unidentified suspect is accused of burglarizing homes and stealing anything he could. Old Lyme residents have allegedly already fallen victim to criminal activities linked to the suspect and are taking steps to obtain an arrest warrant. Police describe the recently released suspect as a Caucasian male in his late 20's. He is possibly working with another man and driving in a dark blue or similar colored Honda, though the vehicle's information has not been confirmed.

{"story_id":280,"story_clean":"A Dobie Middle School teacher was recently arrested after being charged with continually sexually abusing a student since May, according to newly released court documents.  Pedro Esteban Rosas Martinez, 30, was identified as the English as a Second Language teacher at the school located at 1200 E. Rundberg Lane who now faces serious jail time for his alleged actions. According to affidavit-based report in the Austin American-Statesman, the disgraced teacher is accused of placing his hand on the inner thigh of a 12-year-old student and touching her private parts.  Cellphone video the student provided campus police shows a man at a desk moving his hand between the child's knee and vaginal areas, according to the affidavit. After viewing the video, Austin ISD officials contacted the suspect, who was wearing the same clothes as the man in the video, according to the report.   The suspect was placed on administrative leave with pay on Oct. 31, according to a letter for parents written by Principal Jesse De La Huerta, according the the report. The child reportedly later told school officials that Rosas Martinez repeatedly assaulted her since early May when she was in sixth grade. An arrest warrant was issued for the suspect Nov. 17.

{"story_id":294,"story_clean":"A federal grand jury in Los Angeles on indicted a 69-year-old Montrose man accused of traveling to Thailand to have sex with boys as young as 14. Paul Alan Shapiro is charged with one count each of illicit sexual conduct in foreign places and sex trafficking of a minor, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. Prosecutors allege that in February 2010, Shapiro flew from Los Angeles to Thailand, where he paid underage boys small amounts of local currency in order to engage in various sex acts with them. Shapiro also took photographs of himself engaging in sexually explicit conduct with the boys, the indictment alleges. \"Child predators cannot flee the United States in the hope of having a safe haven for their criminal conduct,\" said Eileen M. Decker, the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles. \"To protect the most vulnerable among us, my office will pursue Americans who seek to exploit children in other countries.\" According to the  Pattaya Mail , a Thai newspaper, Shapiro was arrested in Thailand in 2012 after allegedly being caught in the midst of a lewd act with a 13-year-old boy in a mall restroom. He told investigators he'd purchased the services of the boy for 300 baht -- about $8.50, the Pattaya Mail reported at the time. Shapiro received a royal pardon in Thailand last year so that he could be deported back to the United States to face charges, according to the newspaper. \u2014  City News Service, photo via Shutterstock","author_belief":79.125,"author_belief_highlight":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.0,0.0,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.25,0.125,0.125,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0],"suspect_committedCrime":90.875,"suspect_committedCrime_highlight":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.25,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

The three men all agreed to pay $100 to a fund for crime victims and perform 10 hours of community service each, the paper reports.  In June Rhode Island police arrested Michael Horrigan, 29, of North Stonington, his roommate Tristan J. Kading, 28, and Emily E. Kading, 26, of Stonington, The Westerly Sun  reported. Swift was not at the beach house when the three allegedly threw beer bottles onto her Watch Hill property on Bluff Avenue. A guard also reported the suspects flipped off patrolmen and shouted expletives at them. Horrigan reportedly ran toward the house when a patrolman approached the three suspects. Tristan Kading and Emily Kading were handcuffed while an officer went after Horrigan and arrested him. USA Today  reported the three were charged with misdemeanor breach of peace. TMZ staff  reportedly got in touch with Tristan Kading, who told TMZ they didn't flip off the guards, but they were making peace signs reminiscent of Swift in her music video for \"22.\" Tristan Kading also told  TMZ  the incident was the result of drinking, and \"they harbored no ill will toward Swift.\"","author_belief":63.0,"author_belief_highlight":[0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.2857142857,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1428571429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0],"suspect_committedCrime":72.8571428571,"suspect_committedCrime_highlight":[0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.2857142857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.0]}

The man was detained by officers at 9:47 a.m. \u2013 21 minutes after that silent alarm came in. The accused robber was positively identified by two witnesses to the robbery, deputies said. He has been identified as Vincent Anthony Ianellia. \"The suspect is being cooperative and said he was down on his luck and needed money to pay his hotel bill. No weapon was displayed or recovered. The money was recovered at the location at the Travel Inn, where the suspect was detained and subsequently arrested.\" Ianellia was being booked into the Land O' Lakes Jail Tuesday afternoon. A booking photo was not yet available. Keep up with what's happening by  following New Port Richey Patch on Facebook.

This link   explains the name removal request process for NH Patch police reports. According to police, on Aug. 28, officers were sent to Gilley's PM Lunch at around 11 p.m. for a report of a theft from a tip jar. Investigators, according to Sgt. Kuffer R. Kaltenborn, determined that a customer stole tips from a jar that was on top of a corner after a clerk had turned her back to the suspect.  \"As part of the investigation, security footage was obtained and a picture of the suspect was captured,\" Kaltenborn noted.  Three days ago, police posted the information on Facebook and media outlets also shared the picture and video. The next day, both Portsmouth Police and Seacoast Crime Stoppers fielded \"extensive\" tips from the public and the suspect was \"quickly, positively identified and interviewed,\" according to Kaltenborn. McPhee turned himself in on a warrant last night. Police estimated the theft to be about $60 in tips. He was processed and released on personal recognizance bail and is due in court on Sept. 24.  \"The Portsmouth Police Department would like to express its gratitude to those community members, businesses and civic organizations who assisted in this matter,\" Kaltenborn said in a statement. \"Your contributions brought this investigation to a quick and successful resolution.\"","author_belief":72.0,"author_belief_highlight":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.0,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1666666667,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.1666666667],"suspect_committedCrime":93.1666666667,"suspect_committedCrime_highlight":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1666666667,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.3333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

{"story_id":1729,"story_clean":"Two men have been arrested in connection with a carjacking earlier this month that left a teenager with a gunshot wound to his leg, Mountain View police said Wednesday.  The carjacking happened at about 11:30 a.m. on Feb. 2 and police responded to Bay and Centre streets to find a 17-year-old boy had been shot.  Police said he was an employee at a nearby America's Tires business, and told officers a man had walked up to him, told him he wanted a car the victim was standing near, then shot him in the leg.  The man and another suspect then allegedly stole a blue Subaru sedan and fled from the area.  The boy was taken to a hospital with a tourniquet applied to his leg and was released a few days later. Police said he is recovering from his injuries at home.  On Feb. 3, Contra Costa County sheriff's deputies observed the stolen Subaru in Richmond and tried to conduct a traffic stop. The driver tried to escape but crashed the car, and 21-year-old Eduardo DeJesus Flores was taken into custody.  Marcos Mendoza Alcalde, 29, who is suspected of shooting the victim, was arrested while leaving his apartment in Richmond on Monday. Richmond police assisted in the arrest and Alcalde was taken into custody after hailing a ride-hailing vehicle.  Police said the ride-hailing vehicle was safely pulled over and Alcalde was detained by police. Both suspects were arrested on suspicion of carjacking, assault with a deadly weapon and conspiracy to commit a crime.  Alcalde also has an outstanding warrant, according to Mountain View police. There are no other suspects in the shooting and carjacking, police said. --Bay City News\/Image via Shutterstock","author_belief":79.0,"author_belief_highlight":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2666666667,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.3333333333,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2],"suspect_committedCrime":91.6,"suspect_committedCrime_highlight":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.25,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

At 8:20 p.m., police were dispatched to an apartment complex parking lot on Sonoma Street, in San Rafael's Canal neighborhood.  A man had allegedly approached a man and demanded money, left and returned with another suspect.  One of the suspects showed a replica gun and threatened the victim and his child, police said. The victim got away, and several witnesses confronted the suspects. A fight broke out, and both suspects fled.

{"story_id":855,"story_clean":"An Oxford woman is accused of stealing jewels and coins from a Naugatuck family member's house, and allegedly pawning the stolen items at local pawn shops, Naugatuck police say.  Police say Ashley Duquette, 23, of Oxford Road, was arrested on a warrant Sunday for an incident that occurred on Feb. 20.  On that date, Naugatuck police responded to Osborn Road on a larceny complaint.

{"story_id":113,"story_clean":"A 29-year-old Kirkland man was arrested Wednesday on suspicion of first-degree rape and burglary after allegedly breaking into the apartment of a female neighbor at a complex in Juanita and assaulting her. The man was booked into King County Jail in Seattle just after 10 p.m. Wednesday, with bail denied pending his arraignment. Kirkland Police Department spokesman Lt. Mike Murray confirmed the arrest, which occurred at an apartment complex along Northeast 138th in Juanita. He said police were called at about 3:30 Wednesday afternoon. Murray declined to provide more details since the case remains under investigation. But he said he did not believe the victim suffered severe injuries beyond the sexual assault.

{"story_id":1740,"story_clean":"Two men who allegedly took part in an armed robbery at a Palm Desert ATM were in custody this week. Marco Hernandez, 24, of Palm Desert, and Joshua Stratton, 37, of Desert Hot Springs, are accused in the Monday afternoon robbery at an ATM in the 74900 block of Country Club Drive. At 2:40 p.m., one of the men allegedly robbed a person at gunpoint while wearing a mask, \"took an undisclosed amount of money\" from the victim and fled the scene, according to sheriff's Investigator Armando Munoz, who said the victim was not harmed during the holdup. Deputies did not disclose what led them to identify Hernandez and Stratton as suspects, but said Hernandez was arrested Tuesday, when law enforcement served a search warrant at a home in the 77700 block of Michigan Drive in Palm Desert. Stratton was arrested Wednesday at a home in the 65900 block of Cahuilla Drive in Desert Hot Springs, where investigators found \"evidence connected to the robbery,\" as well as \"an illegal assault rifle,\" Munoz said.

{"story_id":1632,"story_clean":"The six suspects in a New Year's Eve pawn shop robbery in Cumming have now been linked to the December robbery of a local gun club. The same suspects, most of whom are accused of gang ties, have been charged with robbing Forsyth County Pawn Shop and the Bullseye Marksman Gun Club, also in Cumming. According to the Forsyth County Sheriff's Office, during the December 31 investigation of the pawn shop robbery, two firearms located in the getaway vehicle had serial numbers matching ones stolen earlier from the gun club. In both cases, robbers rammed a truck into the business that was being robbed, then entered through the hole created to rob the place. Five adults and one 16-year-old juvenile were arrested after the New Year's Eve  robbery of the pawn shop , at 211 Atlanta Rd. An employee of the store who was staying there discovered what was happening and fired a single shot at the robbers. No one was injured during the encounter, police say. The sheriff's office announced the connection between that crime and  the gun club robbery  on Tuesday. The suspects in the crimes are: In addition to robbery, burglary and firearm charges, all suspects but Brown are charged with violating the Georgia Gang Act.

The incident occurred just before 5:30 p.m. in the 100 block of E. 5th Street. A 911 caller alerted police to a disturbance between two homeless men. By the time police and medics arrived, they found bystanders performing CPR on the younger man who had been beaten by an older suspect.  Finding him unresponsive, medics rushed him to Dell Seton Medical Center where he was pronounced dead at 6:12 p.m. The deceased man was identified as Andre Farwell, who was 20 years old. Robert Batiste, 63, was previously identified as the alleged attacker.  Related story:  Man Arrested After Fatal Fight In Downtown Austin Batiste was still near the scene upon arrival of police, who viewed video footage of the confrontation from a witness that led to Batiste's arrest for manslaughter.

{"story_id":1534,"story_clean":"The death of 20-year-old Marka \"Willoe\" Watkins \u2014 who had been missing for nearly a month before being found dead in Tuscaloosa County in July \u2014 has resulted in another arrest. Monic Mochell Battles, the wife of one of the first suspects charged, was booked into the Tuscaloosa County Jail on Saturday. Three suspects have already been arrested and charged in her murder . Authorities have charged Kendal Tyler Battles, 29, and Joseph Brandon Nevels, 20, and Devon Trent Hall, 27, with murder and abuse of a corpse.  Court records show that Monic Battles was allegedly at the scene of the crime when Watkins was beaten with a baseball bat and strangled with a cord. Watkins' body was then wrapped in garbage bags and dumped in a well. Investigators were told the three men and a woman \u2013 now identified as Monic Battles - beat Watkins to death, threw her in a well and poured cement on top of her body Investigators took more than 12 hours to excavate the well and recover her body.

{"story_id":442,"story_clean":"A man renting a room in a Mountain View home was arrested this week on child pornography-related charges after police allegedly discovered a hidden camera was placed in the residence's bathroom, according to authorities. The Mountain View Police Department said that on Aug. 14 a woman, who lives on the 2000 block of Middlefield Road, reported receiving \"threatening\" online messages that included private photos of her apparently taken by a camera hidden somewhere inside her home's bathroom. Detectives from the newly formed Cyber Crime Unit said they investigated the premises and did, indeed, find a hidden camera in the bathroom -- a bathroom frequented by a toddler. The Cyber Crime Unit examined devices allegedly owned by 34-year-old Jose Ballesteros, who rented a room at the home, and in at least one of the videos, footage was captured of the child using the bathroom, police said. Ballesteros was arrested on charges of suspected possession of child pornography, manufacturing child pornography, extortion and three counts of using a hidden camera for sexual gratification. The investigation is ongoing, and anyone with additional information can contact either Det. Marco Garcia or Det. Britton Moore at 650-903-6344.

The Burlington police Detective Unit conducted a reverse sting to target \"johns\" on Friday, in an effort to drive prostitution away from Burlington. A female police officer posted ads on a website known for hosting classified ads offering sex for a fee.  \"In conducting these operations, the Burlington Police Department is seeking to send a loud, clear message to those who want to engage in prostitution and would bring women here for the same purpose: Do not bring your business to Burlington,\" Chief Kent said. \"There is no room for this kind of elicit activity in our community.\" While the sting operation was intended to target customers, in the course of monitoring the sting advertisement, Burlington detectives observed a female advertising sex from another Burlington Hotel. Detectives contacted her, made an appointment, and arrested her after an agreement was made to purchase sex.

{"story_id":1398,"story_clean":"Police in South San Francisco have arrested a transient man who allegedly made inappropriate contact with a child over the weekend. According to police, at 3:10 p.m. Tuesday officers located and arrested 63-year-old transient Anthony Miron near the area where the crime allegedly occurred. According to police, they were called around 4 p.m. Saturday after a girl reported that she'd been inside a business on Grand Avenue when she was approached by a strange man who tried to start up a conversation. \"The subject then inappropriately touched the juvenile on her leg and face,\" police said. \"The juvenile felt uncomfortable and left the business.\" After following up on some leads, South San Francisco police say they identified Miron as a suspect in the case. Miron, a registered sex offender, was subsequently arrested on suspicion of numerous offenses including failure to register and taken to the San Mateo County Main Jail in Redwood City, police said.

{"story_id":664,"story_clean":"A suspect accused of breaking off side mirrors of vehicles parked downtown this week was hardly arrested without incident \u2014 instead fighting off officers and biting one in the leg \u2014 as the Austin Police Department detailed on Thursday. The incident occurred on Sept. 17 at around 4 p.m. when officers responded to 611 Neches St. amid reports of a man who was breaking vehicles' side mirrors. By the time officers arrived, the suspect had moved to 6th Street and the southbound Interstate 35 service road, police said in emailed details related to the incident.  When police approached the man later identified as Henry Parker, 47, he is said to have yelled at officers while walking into the path of 6th Street traffic, the department said. Ultimately, Parker was placed in handcuffs while he resisted arrest and taken to the ground as he spit at officers and continued to resist, the Austin Police Department reported.  At one point, Parker allegedly bit an officer's leg as the law enforcement official attempted to subdue him, the APD said. The bite was strong enough to break the officer's skin and draw blood, according to officials. Six other officers sustained abrasions from the struggle, department officials added. During the altercation, police added, Parker's blood spattered and transferred over onto the open wounds, skin, and clothing of the responding officers. Local television stations aired photos of the officers' injuries to illustrate their reports: All five officers and the suspect were checked out at a local hospital where they were treated before being released. As for Parker, he was transported to Travis County Jail and now faces charges for assault on peace officer and resisting.","author_belief":88.4,"author_belief_highlight":[0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.1666666667,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2],"suspect_committedCrime":95.0,"suspect_committedCrime_highlight":[0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

{"story_id":318,"story_clean":"A former Wildomar youth pastor accused of molesting a girl nearly 30 years ago was out of custody Wednesday after posting a $120,000 bond.  Laverne Paul Fox, 60, was arrested in Erie, Pennsylvania, last month and was extradited to Riverside County over the weekend. He had been slated to be arraigned Wednesday afternoon on charges of lewd acts on a child, oral copulation of a minor and forced sexual penetration of a child under 16 years old, but bailed out of the Robert Presley Jail in Riverside on Tuesday night. It was unclear whether Fox would be returning to Pennsylvania or remaining in California until his new arraignment date of Oct. 2 at the Southwest Justice Center in Murrieta. According to sheriff's Sgt. Glenn Warrington, detectives became aware of Fox's alleged offenses while conducting a separate investigation into the sexual abuse of three teenage girls by another youth pastor, 46-year-old Malo Victor Monteiro of Colton. Monteiro, who committed the crimes while employed by the First Baptist Church in Wildomar, pleaded guilty last November to seven sex-related felonies and was sentenced to five years and four months in state prison under a plea agreement authorized by Superior Court Judge Kelly Hansen, without input from the District Attorney's Office. Court records show that Fox is accused of sexual assaults on an unnamed victim in 1991 and 1992.

Police received a call at 12:37 p.m. Thursday regarding an armed man robbing Mechanics Bank at 3640 Mt. Diablo Blvd.  Police later identified the suspect as Joseph Velasco, 34, of Antioch. Velasco allegedly demanded money of employees and then seized it from the bank's cash drawers, police said.  The caller advised police what direction he fled afterward, and officers began searching for him.   Meanwhile, police called on BART officials to temporarily pass trains through the Lafayette station without stopping out of concern that the suspect may have fled there. Police said the suspect was found 10 minutes after the robbery, sitting in a vehicle parked about a mile south of the bank.   When officers made contact, police said the suspect reached for something in his waistband. After struggling with the suspect, officers identified the weapon as a BB gun.   Police said disguises, cash and a note demanding cash was found in Velasco's possession.  Velasco was arrested on suspicion of robbery and several other crimes, police said. He was booked into Martinez Detention Facility. --Bay City News","author_belief":null,"author_belief_highlight":null,"suspect_committedCrime":86.8,"suspect_committedCrime_highlight":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.4,0.4,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2]}
{"story_id":1480,"story_clean":"Sheriff's investigators were asking for the public's help in identifying victims of an alleged escrow fee scam, authorities said Friday. Broker Mario Gonzalez of MCR Escrow Division was arrested at 10:20 a.m. Thursday at the firm's offices in the 18000 block of Studebaker Road by investigators with the sheriff's Fraud and Cyber Crimes Bureau, said Deputy Tina Schrader of the Sheriff's Information Bureau. Gonzalez was suspected of being involved in an escrow fee scam involving 32 victims with a total loss of $498,000, Schrader said. The alleged scam began in 2014 and involved homes fraudulently listed as short sale properties, she said. Victims submitted bids and once chosen were asked to provide escrow fees to secure the properties. Sales were never finalized and fees were not returned to the victims, investigators allege. The 45-year-old Gonzalez was booked into the Norwalk Sheriff's Station for suspicion of grand theft and was released on $70,000 bail, according to sheriff's inmate records. He was scheduled to appear in court Jan. 3. Anyone with information about additional victims was asked to call Detective Keith Clark at (562) 946-7217 or tips can be made anonymously at Crime Stoppers, (800) 222-TIPS (8477). --  City News Service, photo via Shutterstock","author_belief":65.4,"author_belief_highlight":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0],"suspect_committedCrime":77.2,"suspect_committedCrime_highlight":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.6,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}
{"story_id":710,"story_clean":"A University of Georgia psychology professor accused of asking a student to get him prescription drugs while on a spring break trip to Mexico has been arrested on three counts of possession of prescription drugs not in proper container and one count of attempt to obtain dangerous drugs through fraudulent means. Professor Charles Lance allegedly asked a student to buy him bupropion while in Mexico, according to UGA Police Chief Jimmy Williamson. He described the medication as the \"happy, horny, get skinny drug,\" the  Atlanta Journal-Constitution  reports. Instead of buying the drugs, the student told a faculty member, who in turn notified UGA police, reports the  Athens Banner-Herald . The student was initially conflicted on what to do, as the professor held a position of power over her. \"(Lance) placed her in a bad spot, because she was thinking how it might effect her academically if she refused him,\" Williamson told the Athens paper. \"He also placed her in the position of getting in trouble with authorities in Mexico and the United States.\" Investigators searched the professor's office, where they located other prescription drugs not in their original containers, police said. \"The charges made in this case involve common prescription drugs and are not controlled substances,\" Lance's attorney, Elizabeth Grant, told AJC.com. \"I have reviewed the criminal charges and am prepared to vigorously defend all allegations that Dr. Lance attempted to obtain medication by fraud or deceit. \"The remaining charges involve prescription medication being consolidated in a single bottle instead of stored in individual prescription bottles,\" Grant said.

{"story_id":1383,"story_clean":"Police in Brookline have successfully captured the man they believe is behind Sunday's early-morning break-in at a Beacon Street T-Mobile store. On Thursday, after  circulating the above photo  of the alleged suspect, police arrested 55-year-old Daniel E. Blodgett, of Hyde Park, charged with breaking and entering with intent to commit a felony, larceny from a building, malicious damage over $250 and possession of burglarious tools. In order to make their arrest, detectives with BPD reviewed footage from the T-Mobile store and worked with the Boston Regional Intelligence Center (BRIC) as well as other local police agencies in an effort to identify the suspect observed on the videos. Additional information was received through the Boston Police anonymous tip line as well as Fox 25 News Crime Stoppers network.  Initially, police suspected  this break-in  could be connected to similar incidents at Verizon stores in Newton and Dedham.

{"story_id":628,"story_clean":"A second suspect has been arrested in connection to the recent robbery and shooting at BAR in Stratford Center, police announced on Thursday afternoon. The bartender, identified as Regi Woodard on a GoFundMe page, was shot in the abdomen after complying with a gunman's demands to hand over money during a robbery at BAR at about 7 p.m. on Nov. 14. Jachim Brown, 30, of Bridgeport, was arrested Thursday at Bridgeport court on a warrant, according to Capt. Frank Eannotti. Brown was charged with first-degree robbery, first-degree assault, first-degree threatening, criminal possession of a pistol\/revolver, criminal possession of ammunition and carrying a firearm without a permit. He was held at court on a $500,000 bond and was arraigned on Thursday. Police also arrested Eric Chambers, 33, of Bridgeport, earlier this week in connection to robbery. He was charged with first-degree robbery and held on a $250,000 bond. Brown was recently arrested by Bridgeport Police after he exchanged gunfire with an officer following the robbery of a shoe store in the city, according to reports. The Connecticut Post previously reported that the suspect in that incident  could be connected to the shooting  in Stratford. Brown is accused of stealing $1,900 in cash during the armed robbery of EbLens in Bridgeport in which police say he grabbed a female employee and  dragged her by the hair  while holding her at gunpoint, according to NBC. A  GoFundMe page was recently launched  in support of Woodard, who was scheduled to undergo a third surgery after the shooting at BAR.

{"story_id":1307,"story_clean":"Police and federal agents on Tuesday afternoon raided a Bridgeville spa accused of being at the center of a prostitution and human trafficking ring. Three women were arrested and $2,733 in cash was seized from the 88 Spa on Route 50, Bridgeville police Chief Chad King said. Police officers from Bridgeville, Pittsburgh and Allegheny County, and federal agents from the FBI and Immigration and Customs Enforcement raided the business shortly after noon Tuesday. The spa located at the center of the borough's business district across from the main parking lot was suspected almost immediately of being involved in prostitution when it opened in October 2011, King said. \"Pretty much right away we heard something was going on,\" King said. Neighboring business owners complained of the goings-on at the business, King said, but investigators had to get enough evidence before raiding the building. \"We had to be patient,\" King said. Editor's Note: This story was written by Mike Jones, editor of the  Chartiers Valley Patch , where this story was first reported. Three women were living in two rooms of the spa, King said. The building is not zoned as a residential property. Authorities also confiscated six tables in five massage rooms, along with other evidence. They also found a large amount of cash stashed away in two secret containers. King said they are continuing to investigate and more people will probably face charges. \"We're going to hold everyone accountable who we believe knew what was happening,\" King said.

Officers on the overnight shift pulled into the parking lot of the Wheels Sunoco gas station on Stony Hill Road and noticed a red Ford Econoline van parked in front of the building, which was closed at the time. The police then observed two people dressed in black, wearing ski masks, attempting to break into the front doors, according to a release. The suspects fled on foot when they saw the police approach. The Bethel police then called in for assistance from the Brookfield, Newtown, and Connecticut state police. The four agencies established a perimeter around the area to contain the runners. The state police K9 trooper, Union, tracked the suspects across the town line to Newtown, and apprehended Fabian Rodriguez, 34, of Jewett Street in Ansonia, at 4:33 a.m. He was arrested on Mt. Pleasant Road in Newtown. Rodriguez was transported to Danbury hospital where he was treated for \"injuries sustained from a K9 bite,\" according to police.  In the course of their investigation, police determined that the van at the scene of the attempted burglary was stolen earlier that day from Bridgeport. Nothing was stolen from the store. Rodriguez, who was in possession of a ski mask and black gloves when he was apprehended, was charged with interfering with police, attempted burglary, conspiracy to commit burglary, larceny of a vehicle and criminal mischief. He is being held in lieu of bail.

{"story_id":1249,"story_clean":"Officials with the Sonoma County Sheriff's Office said Thursday that DNA evidence has linked a 28-year-old homeless man to an alleged bank robbery that occurred in November 2016 in Santa Rosa. Cesar Garcia Arista, a known transient who authorities say has an extensive criminal history throughout California, is believed to be responsible for walking into the Exchange Bank branch at Sebastopol Road and Dutton Avenue at 1 p.m. Nov. 21, 2016, and demanding money from a teller at gunpoint. The teller gave the robber, who wore dark clothing and a bandana over his face, an undisclosed amount of cash but was also able to give him a dye pack that exploded shortly after he left the bank, sheriff's Sgt. Spencer Crum said. The day of the incident, the suspect was seen running northbound through a parking lot in the 500 block of Sebastopol Road, toward the Joe Radota bike trail, Crum said. \"In this area, detectives found a beanie cap and bandana,\" Crum said. \"During the course of the subsequent investigation, detectives submitted these items to the State Department of Justice Criminal Forensics Laboratory for DNA analysis.\" On June 6, nearly seven months after the robbery, detectives with the sheriff's Violent Crimes Unit received notice that there was a positive DNA match to Arista, who is currently being held in a San Bernardino County jail in connection with an armed carjacking, Crum said. Additionally, Crum said Arista is being investigated in connection with two armed bank robberies in Southern California. The sheriff's detectives assigned to the Santa Rosa investigation, however, have secured a $2-million warrant for Arista's arrest and are awaiting his transfer to Sonoma County pending the matters in Southern California, Crum said.

On Nov. 27, a woman was caught on surveillance video with a Molotov cocktail at the preschool\/daycare in the 32600 block of Alvarado Boulevard. Newark Police released photos of the crime last week, in an attempt to solve a similar crime in Newark. At the time the photos were released, Newark Police noted, \"She attempted to light the Molotov however it would not light. The suspect resorted to removing the wick and smashing the glass door to the school with the bottle, leaving the bottle behind after throwing it through the door.\" After release of the photos, police received an anonymous tip. >>Previous:  Woman Wanted In Arson Attempt: Look At These Photos Detectives from both Union City and Newark contacted Romo at her home.

{"story_id":1255,"story_clean":"On Monday, a local judge granted a motion that all parties and law enforcement involved be enjoined from talking about all substances in the case of Sara Rae Walters,  a 34-year-old Oceola Township woman who was arrested Friday . Brighton Attorney Christine Heckler, who is representing Walters in child protective proceedings in juvenile court, filed the motion for the gag order. Walters, who faces charges of 1st degree child abuse and torture, will have two separate trials: a civil case in juvenile court and a criminal case in district court. She is accused of abusing her 3-year-old step-grandson on Oct. 21. Heckler, frustrated by media coverage of her client, sent the following statement late Saturday: \"...Sara Walters is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. There are facts pertinent to this case and the way that the investigation was conducted that will be appropriately addressed during the court proceedings in this matter. In the meantime, this case should not be tried in the media.\" Police said that on Oct. 21, Walters' 3-year-old step-grandson was admitted to the University of Michigan Pediatric Intensive Care Unit and found to have more than 60 different injuries. After a three-month investigation, officials from the Livingston County Sheriff's Department Detective Bureau said its investigation offered evidence that the child suffered this abuse at the hands of Walters. No motive has been given. There will actually be two child protective proceedings because of Walters' own biological children. It is standard prodedure to hold hearings on each child living in a household whenever allegations of child abuse are made.

{"story_id":1355,"story_clean":"Police arrested two people who led officers on a pursuit in a  stolen vehicle Wednesday in San Leandro and Oakland. At 12:30 p.m., San Leandro police responded to the area of Dutton Avenue and East 14th Street to investigate a vehicle theft that had just occurred. A man and woman were in a stolen vehicle when they were involved in a traffic collision. They immediately fled the scene and stole a commercial truck, then drove away, San Leandro police said. \"Iimmediately following the collision, the two suspects fled the scene and stole another motorist's commercial truck vehicle before driving away,\" the agency said. \"Approximately two hours later, SLPD's Crime Suppression Detectives located the stolen vehicle occupied by the two suspects in the area of 105th Avenue and International Boulevard in Oakland. Both uniformed officers and detectives converged on the suspects in an attempt to take them into custody,\" the department said. As officers converged on the suspects, the driver allegedly accelerated the truck and fled. A pursuit ensued through city streets in Oakland, during which the suspect intentionally rammed three occupied police vehicles and struck an Alameda-Contra Costa Transit bus, police said. The truck became partially disabled because of the collisions, but continued to flee at a low speed for more than eight minutes. It eventually became fully disabled at the intersection of 96th and Bancroft avenues in Oakland, police said. Both suspects were taken into custody without further incident and were arrested on suspicion of multiple felony offenses. Police have not released their names.

{"story_id":1750,"story_clean":"Two people were arrested after a disturbance in the parking lot of a New London Park Saturday evening, police said.  Police received a call around 6:07 p.m. for a woman striking a young child across the face in the parking lot of Ocean Beach Park. An officer assigned to the park responded to the scene and was told that a woman who tried to intervene in the situation had been assaulted.  Police said the woman who tried to intervene was struck with a purse and then punched several times by the suspect, Ciara Subrian, 25, of East Hartford. When the officer approached Subrian, she allegedly struck him and then police say Subrian actively resisted arrest.  A 20-year-old man, identified as Robert Carrion-Rivera, 20, of Holyoke, Massachusetts, began to physically interfere in the situation between the officer and Subrian, police said. The officer then had to call for additional assistance because a large crowd formed around him.  Subrian was taken into custody and Carrion-Rivera fled police by foot before police found him hiding behind a home on Bentley Avenue.

{"story_id":1676,"story_clean":"Three men were arrested for allegedly using numerous counterfeit $100 bills at businesses in Naperville, according to police spokesman Cmdr. Lou Cammiso. The men allegedly used the bills at some stores along Route 59. Police were notified and located the suspects on the 700 block of Route 59. When arrested, the trio had several, but less than ten, counterfeit $100 bills in their possession, according to police.  The three accused of passing the fake bills are the following:  Jermaine Norris, 20, of Maywood ( Photo from Naperville Police ) Charles Boyd, 18, of Chicago ( Photo from Naperville Police ) Terrel Griffin, 19, of DeKalb ( Photo from Naperville Police ) The three men are due in DuPage County Court on March 27.

{"story_id":578,"story_clean":"A possible hate crime is under investigation at Towson University. The two victims were students at the university, and so were the alleged assailants. Towson University President Kim Schatzel called what happened a \"truly deplorable incident,\" issuing a statement Tuesday affirming the university's intolerance of hateful conduct. The incident reportedly began after 2 a.m. on Sunday off campus. Two Alpha Epsilon Pi brothers were walking in the unit block of Aigburth Road around 2:12 a.m. when two other students screamed  slurs  at them, then punched one in the face, according to WJZ.  The police report indicated there were \"anti-Semitic words and actions,\" according to Schatzel. Police found the pair of intoxicated suspects standing over and screaming at one victim, WJZ said, noting nobody was arrested because the victims would have to press charges against the suspects for second-degree  assault . Towson University's Office of Student Conduct and Office of Inclusion and Institutional Equity is conducting a full investigation, according to a statement from the administration, which noted acts of hatred, bias, racism or discrimination are not tolerated. In Maryland,  there were 35 anti-Semitic incidents  in 2017, including 20 vandalism and 15 harassment cases, the Anti-Defamation League reported earlier this year. No assaults were recorded in the group's analysis of Maryland in the past three years. Still, the total number of cases reported in 2017 was a dramatic increase from 2016, when there were three anti-Semitic incidents reported statewide. In 2015, there were nine.

{"story_id":1110,"story_clean":"Harris County Sheriff's Office Homicide investigators have released a sketch of the man wanted in the Dec. 30 shooting death of 7-year-old Jazmine Barnes. Officials were able to get a description of the man and create the sketch based on a description provided by members of Jazmine's family.  Jazmine was in a four-door Dodge passenger car traveling in the southbound lanes of E. Sam Houston Parkway frontage road just south of Wallisville Road, with her mother and three sisters at about 6:50 a.m.  Officials said the man, who was driving a red, four-door pickup, pulled up next to a car driven by LaPorsha Washington and started shooting. Jazmine was shot and killed, and her mother was wounded. The alleged shooter is a thinly built white man, possibly in his 30's or 40's, wearing a black hooded sweatshirt at the time.  Previous reports indicated he was wearing glasses and had a beard, but officials said he was clean shaven and was not wearing glasses. A substantial financial reward is being offered to anyone who is able to provide information that leads to the arrest of a suspect. Anyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers of Houston at 713-222-TIPS, or the Harris County Sheriff's Office at 713-221-6000. Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said his office is grateful for the help of several partner agencies including, but are not limited to: the FBI; the ATF; NASA; the Texas Department of Public Safety; and the Houston Police Department.

The occupants were detained and two loaded firearms were found inside the vehicle. All four occupants were arrested on weapons violations, as no victim had yet been located. About an hour after the original call, officers were sent to a local hospital to investigate the report of a shooting victim.  They found the victim -- identified as Victor Davis, 27, of Pomona, suffering from a non-life-threatening gunshot wound.  Although minimally cooperative, Davis stated that two men approached his car and shot at him in the area of Towne Avenue and Arrow Highway.  His vehicle (a red compact) was also found by officers and was found to have bullet holes in the driver's door, police said. Based on the information received, all four suspects were subsequently charged with attempted murder and held in the Pomona jail in lieu of $500,000 bail. Although an actual motive is not yet known, it appears that the incident may be gang related. Anyone with information regarding this incident is encouraged to contact the Pomona Police Department at 909-620-2085.
