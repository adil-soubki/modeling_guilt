{"story_id":525,"story_clean":"A murder charge was filed Tuesday against a La Puente woman accused of running over her boyfriend with her car outside a motel after an argument last weekend. Sharon Kay Hood, 52, is scheduled to be arraigned June 8 at the Pomona courthouse in connection with the death of Randolph Morales, 51, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office. Authorities said the two -- who had been dating for six years -- started arguing Sunday inside a motel room in the 500 block of North Azusa Avenue in La Puente. Hood abruptly left the room, and when Morales followed her outside, she ran him over with her car, prosecutors allege. He died at the scene. Hood was arrested the same day and has remained behind bars since then. If convicted of the murder charge, which includes the allegation of use of a deadly and dangerous weapon -- an automobile -- during the commission of the crime, Hood could face up to 26 years to life in state prison. -- City News Service, photo via Shutterstock","author_belief":74.7142857143,"author_belief_highlight":[0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.1714285714,0.1428571429,0.125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5238095238,0.4285714286,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.2857142857,0.1428571429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0],"suspect_committedCrime":79.5714285714,"suspect_committedCrime_highlight":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.2857142857,0.3714285714,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.5357142857,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.7142857143,0.7142857143,0.7142857143,0.7142857143,0.7142857143,0.7142857143,0.7142857143,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.4285714286,0.4,0.2857142857,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.0,0.0,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

{"story_id":541,"story_clean":"A New York Police Department officer who lives in East Meadow was arrested on Thursday after authorities say he stole thousands of dollars from his landlord by filing forged military orders to qualify for reduced rent. According to District Attorney Madeline Singas, Eric Smith, 37, stole more than $34,000 from his landlord with the falsified documents. He surrendered on Thursday morning to DA detectives. \"The defendant, a sworn member of the NYPD, is accused of drafting fake military orders and using those orders to dupe his landlord into giving him reduced rent,\" Singas said. \"This benefit exists to help armed services members while they are deployed in defense of our county, but this defendant allegedly filed multiple fake orders and stole more than $34,000 in the process.\" According to Singas, Smith, an NYPD officer in the 41st Precinct, is a former member of the New York Army Air National Guard. From 2011 to 2014, he was on full time assignment to the Joint Task Force Empire Shield and was eligible to receive a reduced rent due to his deployment. Beginning in 2015 and through 2017, Smith allegedly filed forged military orders with his landlord to continue qualifying for reduced rent at the Mitchel Homes in East Meadow. Based on the investigation, Singas said Smith stole approximately $34,014.00 from his landlord, Balfour Beatty LLC, which operates the Mitchel Homes. Smith was arraigned on Thursday and charged with third-degree grand larceny, three counts of second-degree criminal possession of a forged instrument and three counts of first-degree falsifying business records.

{"story_id":1195,"story_clean":"Manhattan Beach police circulated the name and photo of a suspect wanted for allegedly trying to burglarize a home under construction Thursday. Alisha Tapia, 29, is being sought as a suspect in the crime, which occurred about 2 p.m. Sunday in the 100 block of 32nd Place, said Manhattan Beach police Sgt. Tim Zins. \"The reporting party stated a female suspect attempted to burglarize a home under construction,\" Zins said. \"The female was described as wearing a white painter's suit and ventilator mask to disguise her identity.\" The homeowner chased the suspect and took a picture of her, Zins said. Detectives identified Tapia as the woman pictured by the homeowner, and obtained a warrant for her arrest on suspicion of attempted burglary, vandalism, and possession of burglary tools, Zins said. Tapia, whose last known address was in Long Beach, is described as Hispanic, 5 feet 4 inches tall, weighing 155 pounds, with brown hair and eyes.

{"story_id":749,"story_clean":"A Woodstock man has been arrested under the accusation of sexually assaulting a pre-teen girl and is facing multiple felony charges, according to reports. The Northwest Herald reported a Woodstock press release as saying that Daniel Pollet, 35, of the 1400 block of Commons Drive, was charged Wednesday with predatory criminal sexual assault of a child and aggravated criminal sexual abuse. Woodstock police initially found about about the allegation from Centegra Hospital - Huntley officials. Police investigated and met with the victim to interview her. She told police that Pollet, who she knew, but is not a family member, had  sexually assaulted her  on multiple occasions, the Herald reported Woodstock Police Chief John Lieb as saying.

{"story_id":1803,"story_clean":"Washington County deputies on Sunday arrested a suspect who allegedly pointed a gun at three people walking through Vista Brook Park in Raleigh Hills. The suspect, Kadin E. Moore, told deputies it was a prank, and the gun, investigators learned, was just a realistic-looking toy Airsoft pistol. Moore, 19, of Beaverton, was taken to Washington County Jail and charged with menacing. Moore has since been released.  Deputies were dispatched just after 11 p.m. Aug. 26 to Vista Brook Park, 6697 S.W. 88th Ave. after a group of people asked a homeowner in the neighborhood to call 911.  The group of three later told deputies they were walking through the park when a person approached and pointed a gun at them. It's unclear if any words were said, but the trio reportedly ran out of the park toward a random home, where they asked the resident to call police.  After the trio described the suspect and the gun, deputies searched the park and along Fanno Creek Trail \u2014 where  on July 19 a 28-year-old woman was assaulted and raped .  After a brief search, deputies reportedly found Moore and identified her as the suspect based on witness descriptions. Moore, who identifies as a woman, told investigators she was just playing a prank on the three victims. None of the victims knew Moore prior to incident, sheriff's officials said.  After Moore's arrest, deputies learned the gun was an Airsoft toy. Moore does not have any apparent criminal history in Oregon. Sheriff's officials confirmed there is no reason to believe this incident is at all connected to  the sexual assault that occurred in July . Anyone with information about either incident, however, is encouraged to call Washington County Sheriff's deputies at 503-629-0111.

{"story_id":1431,"story_clean":"Police say a Scott Township man sexually assaulted his daughter's 9-year-old friend during several sleepovers in 2008. Roland V. McFarland, 61, is charged with two counts each of indecent assault and unlawful contact with a minor, along with one count each of child endangerment, corruption of minors and false imprisonment. According to a criminal complaint supporting his arrest, McFarland carried the girl to his bed on \"several occasions\" when she stayed over for sleepovers with her friend at their home in Glendale. The girl told police McFarland touched her inappropriately and made her touch his genitals. Other times, she was able to fight him off, police said. said the girl, who is now 14, came forward last month after talking to her parents about what happened. Scott police Sgt. Jeff Skees said she didn't discuss it before because she was \"embarrassed and ashamed\" about what happened. However, the girl's parents said they had suspicions and confronted McFarland in 2008. He denied the accusations, police said, and the parents decided the best way to handle the situation was to keep their daughter away from McFarland and his home in Glendale. WPXI-TV is also reporting that  police filed additional charges against Roland , accusing him of sexually assaulting a second girl.

{"story_id":864,"story_clean":"Andrea Sneiderman is set to be arraigned for a third time Tuesday, now that a judge has thrown out four non-murder charges against her. Sneiderman is accused of arranging for the death of her husband, Rusty Sneiderman, who was gunned down outside their children's Dunwoody daycare in 2010. Sneiderman's former boss, Hemy Neuman, was charged with Rusty Sneiderman's death. He was found guilty but mentally ill by a jury in 2012. Sneiderman is still facing malice murder and felony murder charges in connection with the death of her late husband, along with charges for allegedly giving false statements to law enforcement officials. However, DeKalb County Superior Judge Gregory Adams ruled on May 1 that four counts of in the indictment \"did not meet the standard\" for criminal indictments. She was first arraigned on an eight-count indictment and then a second time when additional charges were added. Now, she is being arraigned after charges have been dismissed and clarified. In former arraignments, Sneiderman has pleaded not guilty to charges against her. She has also repeatedly denied any involvement in her husband's death or any romantic involvement with her former boss, Neuman. She is currently living under house arrest at her parents' home after she was released on bond a few weeks after her arrest.

{"story_id":1599,"story_clean":"The Marin County District Attorney's Office filed murder charges Tuesday against two Novato High School students and an accessory to  murder charge against a third student .   Juan Carlos Martinez Henriquez, 17, and Edwin Guevara, 16, are charged with the  premeditated shooting murder  while lying in wait of Edwin Josue Ramirez Guerra, 17, of San Rafael on Wednesday.   The complaint identifies Martinez Henriquez as the shooter, but alleges Guevara also was armed with a firearm.  Both teens also are charged with the attempted murder of a second student, who was shot and stabbed but survived, on May 25.   Martinez Henriquez also is charged with aggravated mayhem for allegedly intentionally disfiguring part of Ramirez Guerra's body.   A third defendant, Elmer Fernando Machado-Rivera, 21, of San Rafael, is charged with being an accessory to the murder and attempted murder by harboring and concealing Martinez Henriquez to avoid arrest and prosecution.   The teen victims, also Novato High School students, were found around 5:30 p.m. at the end of Fairway Drive miles from Novato High School.   The student who survived called 911 and identified the three suspects, and Ramirez Guerra was found dead at the scene. Marin County sheriff's officials have not said what the crime was about.

{"story_id":1485,"story_clean":"Six defendants have been indicted in connection to an armed robbery reported in September just outside downtown Canton. A Cherokee County grand jury on Tuesday, Jan. 9 indicted Nicole Ann Clary of Jasper, William Elijah Harris of Acworth, Shamer Lamar Jones of Canton, Marissa Elizabeth Lemieux of Jasper, Brittany Elizabeth McGuire of Jasper and Deshaun Gabriel Tiller of Canton each on two counts of aggravated assault and one count each of armed robbery and possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute. They are accused of robbing a man of money and drugs at a home on Sept. 21 on Jefferson Circle. According to the indictment, the defendants held up the victim using a BB gun and stole $230 from him during the robbery.  Officers with the Canton Police Department were dispatched to the call of a  robbery  and met with the victim, who was able to provide police with a description of the suspected vehicle. Police tracked down the red Dodge Dart on East Main Street near Interstate 575, conducted a traffic stop and took the suspects into custody.  Meanwhile, officers and detectives arrived at the residence and began working the crime scene as part of the investigation. Additional statements were taken and a search warrant was secured for the residence.

{"story_id":892,"story_clean":"Authorities arrested two men following a pursuit from San Lorenzo that ended with a car crash in Walnut Creek on Wednesday night, an Alameda County sheriff's spokesman said today.  Shortly before 10 p.m., deputies in the area of Hesperian Boulevard and Grant Avenue attempted to make a traffic stop on a vehicle, sheriff's Sgt. J.D. Nelson said. Nelson said the vehicle's driver failed to yield to the deputies and led them on a chase through Castro Valley and into Dublin and then onto Interstate Highway 680.   At that point, Nelson said the deputies stopped pursuing the car and California Highway Patrol officers picked up the chase, passing through San Ramon and Danville. The officers followed the car into Walnut Creek, where it crashed. The two men inside the car were then arrested on suspicion of evading law enforcement officers and for outstanding warrants, Nelson said.   The CHP officers also found items in the car reported stolen from prior burglaries, and Nelson said detectives are still trying to determine the suspects' involvement in those alleged crimes.   Nelson said he didn't have information on where or when the burglaries occurred.   As of this afternoon, Nelson said the names of the two men arrested are not being released because detectives were still investigating their possible involvement in other crimes. --Bay City

{"story_id":207,"story_clean":"A Beaumont man was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of lewd and lascivious acts with a minor under 14 years of age, police announced. Sixty-year-old Miguel Lazo is accused of sexually assaulting one of his own young family members.  According to police, the arrest stems from a months-long investigation into the allegations that first arose when officers were called to a local hospital emergency room in early 2018 \"to investigate a report that a female juvenile had been sexually assaulted by a family member,\" according to a police statement.  \"It was determined that the alleged assault occurred in a family member's residence in the City of Beaumont,\" police said.  A warrant was issued for Lazo, who is a teacher in the El Monte Union High School District, after the case was submitted to and reviewed by the Riverside County District Attorney's office, police said.

{"story_id":1029,"story_clean":"Devon Evans stands accused of burglarizing a Sarasota home last month while the people inside slept. So it might seem fitting that Sarasota Police officers say Evans was brought into custody after a tipster told detectives they could find him sleeping in a van. The case that led to 27-year-old's arrest unfolded in the early morning hours of April 24. At the time, police said someone forced their way into a home in the 1000 block of Cocoanut Avenue. The burglar, police noted in an email to media, removed several items of value before leaving. The home's occupants slept through the burglary and were uninjured. Get the  Sarasota Patch newsletter and alerts in your inbox . Shortly after the burglary, police announced Evans as a suspect. He remained elusive until May 12 around 4:25 a.m. when a tip came in that he could be found sound asleep in a van parked in the area of 29th Street and Dixie Avenue, the police department reported. That tip paid off, authorities say. Evans was charged with one felony count of burglary of an occupied dwelling.

{"story_id":613,"story_clean":"A San Fernando Valley man who allegedly attacked a man in a red hat bearing the slogan \"Make America Great Again\" written in Russian while in the restroom of a Hermosa Beach bar pleaded not guilty Thursday to three felony charges. David Delgado, 32, of Winnetka, is charged with one count each of assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury, battery with serious bodily injury and second-degree robbery, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office. The criminal complaint also alleges that Delgado personally inflicted great bodily injury. Delgado allegedly approached a man using a restroom in the bar on Labor Day, asked the meaning of the Russian writing on the hat, then punched the victim repeatedly in the face, causing him to fall to the ground, according to Hermosa Beach Police Department Sgt. Robert Higgins. \"The suspect continued to punch the victim and then stole the victim's hat and fled,\" according to Higgins. The man suffered serious injuries, according to prosecutors.

{"story_id":961,"story_clean":"Central Catholic High School's guidance counselor is being accused of selling heroin from her Forest Hills apartment. Forest Hills police have charged Kelly Scherer, 36, with conspiracy, two counts of possession of a controlled substance, two counts of possession with the intent to deliver and two counts of prohibited acts. According to KDKA , Scherer, the counselor at the Oakland private school, is accused of dealing heroin and selling it to an undercover police officer. According to WPXI , police found about 150 needles and at least 50 stamp bags of suspected heroin in her Sumner Avenue apartment at the time of her arrest. A statement released from Central Catholic said Scherer had been suspended due to \"unsatisfactory job performance\" and was not acting as the school's counselor at the time of her arrest.

Brian O'Keefe of the Manchester Police Department. Editor's Note:  This post was derived from information supplied by the Manchester Police Department. It does not indicate a conviction.  This link  explains the name removal request process for NH Patch police reports. \"However, the card was declined, and the suspect began arguing with the 25-year-old clerk and started to head toward the exit with the can of beer,\" O'Keefe alleged. \"The clerk managed to block his egress until the suspect brandished a knife, so the clerk immediately backed away and allowed the man to flee his store with the stolen item.\" The suspect is described as a Caucasian man with a slender build and brown hair that is thinning. He also had a goatee. The suspect was wearing jeans and a black and red winter coat.

{"story_id":407,"story_clean":"A man accused of killing a Golden resident, then stealing his truck and guns, fleeing to Salt Lake City and and gunning down a Chinese student, pleaded guilty to murder and kidnapping charges. Austin Jeffery Boutain, 24, entered guilty pleas Wednesday in Utah for an agreement that would avoid a possible death penalty. He was sentenced to life without parole. Austin Boutain, and his wife, Kathleen Elizabeth Rose Boutain, 23, were accused of  carjacking a vehicle owned by Chenwei Guo , a University of Utah  student from Beijing,  and then killing him in October of 2017. Kathleen Boutain  is charged with criminal solicitation and theft, the Associated Press reported. She has not entered a plea. The two were drifters who showed up in Golden before they went to Utah. The  Boutains allegedly got into an argument with 63-year old Mitchell Bradford Ingle  while staying in his RV trailer at Clear Creek RV Park, 1401 10th St. Bradford was murdered and the Boutains are accused of  stealing his pickup truck and several guns and making their way to Salt Lake City. The Boutains face murder and theft charges in Colorado.

{"story_id":1057,"story_clean":"Felony charges were filed today against a photographer and children's tumbling teacher accused of sexually assaulting a teenage girl and being in possession of child pornography.  Christopher A. Brown, 42, of Orange, was arrested last Friday at a Newport Beach shopping center and held in lieu of $500,000 bail, according to Orange County sheriff's Lt. Jeff Hallock.  He's scheduled to be arraigned today on felony charges of possession of child pornography, sexual penetration by a foreign object of an underage victim, committing a lewd or lascivious act with a minor and forcible oral copulation.  Investigators suspect there may be more alleged victims, as Brown also teaches private tumbling lessons for children and has traveled the country working as a freelance photographer, Hallock said.  Investigators recovered hundreds of child porn photos and videos when a search warrant was executed at a hotel in Irvine where Brown had been staying, Hallock alleged. Investigators recovered hundreds of child porn photos and videos when a search warrant was executed at a hotel in Irvine where Brown had been staying, he said. Brown has a conviction in 2005 in Virginia for possession of child pornography, and failed to register as a sex offender in California when he moved into the state several years ago, according to Hallock.  Detectives suspect Brown targets teenage girls, the lieutenant said. Anyone aware of adolescents Brown may have victimized was urged to call the sheriff's department at (714) 647-7418.

{"story_id":930,"story_clean":"Bond has been set at $100,000 for a 44-year-old Highwood man accused of sexually assaulting a 19-year-old woman he worked with, police said. Victor Manuel Martinez-Lopez, of the 300 block of Ashland Avenue, is charged with unlawful restraint and criminal sexual assault, both felony charges, and battery, a misdemeanor charge, according to a news release from the Vernon Hills Police Department. Authorities launched an investigation into the sexual assault after a father called police to report that he allegedly observed Martinez-Lopez pin his daughter against the wall of the restaurant where both worked in the 1200 block of South Milwaukee Avenue in Vernon Hills.  The father said the man then kissed the 19-year-old woman, according to the news release. The incident occurred on April 14 and the father reported the alleged sex assault to police two days later.

ABC7 reported she was out on her usual morning walk, between 5:50 a.m. and 6:01 a.m., near Rural and Ohio when she was approached from behind. The suspect demanded valuables. When she told him she didn't have any, she was allegedly pushed to the ground and kicked in the face. Police say the suspect then came back and battered her again before running away. The victim knocked on a nearby door asking for help, but nobody answered. The suspect then returned again,  attacking her once more  before running northbound on Ohio. She then knocked on another door in the 900 block of Mountain Street, where the owner answered and called the police for her. Paramedics checked her out at the scene, ABC7 reported, but she refused to go to the hospital. She described the suspect as a black male around 20 years old, about 5-foot-1 and weighed around 150 pounds. Anybody with information is urged to call the Aurora police at 630-256-5500, or call CrimeStoppers at 630-892-1000. CrimeStoppers calls are anonymous and may yield a reward up to $5,000 if the information leads to an arrest.

{"story_id":135,"story_clean":"A 33-year-old Yorkville man who was arrested Friday, March 11 for exposing himself to a female jogger is believed to be the  same man who committed a similar crime  in late February.  Christopher A. Assmar, of the 300 block of Orange Street, was charged with one felony count of public indecency and one misdemeanor count of the same offense, Oswego Police Department Public Information Officer Cathy Nevara said in a press release.  At around 1 p.m. March 11, a female jogger called police after a male driver reportedly asked her for directions and exposed himself at Bloomfield Circle East and Colchester Drive.  The incident is nearly identical to the one that occurred two weeks ago  and the description of the man matched what was given before, according to Nevara.  During the investigation, detectives identified Assmar as a possible suspect and made contact with him at his home, where he was subsequently arrested at around 5:45 p.m., Nevara said.  Police believe Assmar is the same man who exposed himself in the Feb. 27 incident. In that instance, Assmar also allegedly called out to two children, who ignored him and ran away, according to Nevara.

{"story_id":41,"story_clean":"A $10,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of a man suspected of at least 13 bank robberies across five states since December 2016. Known among law enforcement agencies as the \"Double Hat Bandit,\" the man is accused of four bank robberies in Oregon alone, including three in the Portland metro area, two of which occurred at the same location in Portland six months apart.  So called due to his penchant for wearing a beanie over a baseball cap during his robberies, the Double Hat Bandit typically hits bank branches located inside grocery stores, according to the FBI, which is also the agency offering the reward. (Metro Denver Crime Stoppers is offering a separate reward of $2,000.)  During the robberies, FBI officials said, the Double Hat Bandit gave bank tellers a note demanding cash, and during at least four of the robberies he displayed a handgun in his waistband.  The most recent robbery attributed to the Double Hat Bandit occurred on July 22 at the U.S. Bank located at 7100 W. State St. in Boise, Idaho. The 12 other robberies for which he is accused are:  Following the June 27 robbery in Spokane, which was the second time he allegedly robbed that particular bank branch, the Double Hat Bandit was seen escaping in a grayish-blue Malibu-style car with New Mexico license plates, FBI officials said. Law enforcement agencies in Utah, Washington, Oregon, Colorado, and Idaho are searching for the Double Hat Bandit.

{"story_id":1018,"story_clean":"Denver police and Crime Stoppers announced today that an anonymous donor has boosted a reward offered for information about a man accused of sexually assaulting a woman in her home in a mid-day attack. A reward of $5,000 is now being offered for information leading to the arrest of Jerome Lekendric Lucas, 34, who is facing possible charges of sex assault, kidnapping and burglary. Police said on March 24, Lucas allegedly entered a woman's house on a Sunday afternoon and sexually assaulted her, then stole several items from her home, including her car, which has been recovered.  \"The nature of this crime [including] burglary and sex assault on a Sunday afternoon in broad daylight, is not anything I have been a part of in my 16-year career,\" said Detective Lang of the Denver Police Sex Crimes Unit. \"We need to get him off the streets. He is a danger to the community.\" Lucas has a long criminal history including theft, assault, burglary, drug and weapons possession, and car theft, police said.

{"story_id":231,"story_clean":"A Cabazon man accused of attacking his mother and holding her against her will must stand trial on charges of assault, false imprisonment and dissuading a witness, a judge ruled Thursday. Richard Anthony Diaz, 32, was arrested March 20 following the alleged assault that took place in the 14000 block of Marino Street. Diaz's mother -- a 54-year-old woman referred to only as Jane Doe in court documents -- went to the Cabazon sheriff's station at 9:42 a.m. that day to allege that her son had assaulted her, Riverside County Sheriff's Sgt. John Carlberg said. Diaz was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, but prosecutors filed a lesser charge of assault with a deadly weapon against him, along with the false imprisonment count. The deadly weapon was the defendant's hands, according to the criminal complaint. Prosecutors later amended the charges to assault on a person causing great bodily injury and added a felony count of dissuading a witness. Diaz remains free on $25,000 bail after being released from custody on March 24. He's slated to return to court on Aug. 16 for a post-preliminary hearing arraignment.

{"story_id":289,"story_clean":"A DuPage County judge lowered the bail for a Cicero woman accused of losing control of her car, driving into an Aurora retention pond, and leaving her son inside. Gladys Ruvira-Garcia's bail was originally set at $500,000 after the accident, but Judge Liam Brennan reduced it to $150,000. Ruvira-Garcia currently has a hold placed on her by Immigrations Custom and Enforcement because she allegedly entered the United States with an expired visa.  Ruvira-Garcia's family, many of whom were present in court during the hearing, was able to raise $10,000, according to Chicago Tribune. If she's able to post 10% of the reduced bond, ICE may issue a warrant for her arrest on the grounds of the alleged immigration violation, Chicago Tribune reports.  Brennan made the decision to lower Ruvira-Garcia's bail after her attorney's asserted that her clean criminal record should be taken into account.  Ruvira-Garcia was arrested after her car spun out of control and landed in a retention pond while she was on her way back to Cicero from a party she attended with her son and other women and teens from her family. The females were able to escape, but  Ruvira-Garcia's son  was left trapped inside the immersed vehicle.  After the accident, police said Ruvira-Garcia's BAC was .14, nearly twice the legal limit.  She plead not guilty to four counts of aggravated driving under the influence.  Ruvira-Garcia's son, who was trapped in the car, is still hospitalized, her attorneys told Chicago Tribune. He had been on a ventilator and is expected to have permanent brain damage.  >>Image via DuPage County State's Attorney's Office >>More via Chicago Tribune","author_belief":62.0,"author_belief_highlight":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0],"suspect_committedCrime":88.0,"suspect_committedCrime_highlight":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.1666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,0.3333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}
{"story_id":419,"story_clean":"A man and woman accused of committing an armed robbery at an East Granby convenience store Wednesday afternoon were taken into custody shortly thereafter by Bloomfield police officers and a Connecticut State Police trooper. Around 2:15 p.m., a clerk at the NH Deli and Grocery convenience store at 95 Spoonville Road reported being robbed by a man wielding a knife. Investigation revealed the suspect and an unknown woman left the scene in a dark-colored pickup truck, a state police report says. A description of the vehicle and suspects was broadcast to police in surrounding towns, and the truck was stopped in Bloomfield and the pair arrested, according to the report. Thomas Phillips, 50, of Windsor, was charged with first-degree robbery, second-degree reckless endangerment, second-degree criminal mischief and sixth-degree larceny. Alisha Phillips, 24, of East Windsor, was charged with criminal attempt to commit first-degree robbery and interfering with an officer.

{"story_id":1523,"story_clean":"The Cherokee Sheriff's Office has issued arrest warrants for a 19-year-old man accused of stealing from vehicles in the Acworth area late last month.  Demone Ontray Allen is suspected of entering at the vehicles of two victims Aug. 30 in the Centennial Lakes subdivision and taking items such as a laptop, credit cards and a firearm, sheriff's office spokesperson Jay Baker said.  Detectives have learned those stolen credit cards were used at establishments in Kennesaw and at shops in Atlantic Station. On Friday, Aug. 31, Allen was arrested and charged by Atlanta police following a chase of a stolen vehicle. That vehicle, Backer added, included several items stolen from victims in Cherokee County.    Allen was charged by Atlanta police with theft by receiving, entering auto, prowling, obstruction, possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime, fleeing and attempting to elude police and criminal damage to property in the second degree. He was booked into the Fulton County Jail on Sept. 1, and released on bond the same day. Baker said that release occurred before Cherokee sheriff's investigators learned of the incident.  Allen, of Lithonia, is wanted in Cherokee County on burglary, entering auto, felony theft by taking, misdemeanor theft by taking, financial card theft and financial card fraud charges.

{"story_id":1163,"story_clean":"Joaquin Mendez, 27 | Cook County Sheriff SUMMIT, IL -- A 27-year-old fence installer is accused of beating his pregnant girlfriend unconscious and battling cops during a domestic battery call, prosecutors said Monday in court. Joaquin Mendez, 27, appeared before Cook County Judge Peter Felice on charges of aggravated domestic battery, five counts of aggravated battery to a police officer, two misdemeanor counts of resisting arrest, misdemeanor assault and misdemeanor criminal damage to property. Summit police responded to a domestic disturbance call around 4:20 p.m. April 17. According to the charges, Mendez and his girlfriend, who is 22 weeks pregnant, had gotten into a verbal argument that escalated into physical altercation. During the fight, Mendez allegedly kneed the pregnant woman multiple times in the stomach and beat her unconscious. She was taken to MacNeal Hospital in Berwyn where she received five staples in her hairline and treatment for a black eye and scratches on her arms, the prosecutor said. Police said Mendez was verbally combative when they tried to take him into custody. During the arrest, police said Mendez physically fought them and spit blood at an officer.  Later, the prosecutor said, Mendez apologized to police and told them he was intoxicated.

{"story_id":1153,"story_clean":"INWOOD, NY \u2014 Five members of a gang that operated for years in Northern Manhattan were indicted on robbery, narcotics and firearms charges following a recent takedown, federal prosecutors said. Prosecutors also linked the gang to a 2014 murder, but have yet to take the accused shooting into custody. Milton Chardon, Bryan Castillo, George Citronelle, Noel Martinez and Juan Calderon were arrested this week and hit with charges including racketeering, conspiracy to deal narcotics, robbery, burglarizing pharmacies and firearms offenses, federal prosecutors announced. One other accused gang member, Yasmil Fertides was already in custody, prosecutors said. The men allegedly committed crimes between 2011 and 2018 in the name of the 200 Gang, federal prosecutors said. The gang was allegedly behind the 2014 murder of Orlando Rivera, who was shot in front of a building on St. Nicholas Avenue, but the accused gunman Christian Pabon was not taken into custody during the gang bust, federal prosecutors said. \"The defendants wreaked havoc on their northern Manhattan neighborhood for years through a litany of crimes that harmed local businesses, injured robbery victims, and killed an innocent man,\" U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Geoffrey Berman said in a statement. In addition to the 2014 murder, gang members were also accused of an attempted murder in 2015 on Sherman Avenue and a 2016 shooting on Academy Street and Nagle Avenue, federal prosecutors said. The gang also ran a burglary operation targeting pharmacies in the Washington Heights and Inwood neighborhoods as well as in the Bronx.

{"story_id":1368,"story_clean":"Police have arrested a man in connection with the sexual assault of four women in Reston 22 years ago. Florida authorities arrested 49-year-old Jude Joseph David Lovchik near his home in Ocala, Fla., last Wednesday. He is accused of sexually assaulting four women in an apartment in the 11000 block of Olde Tiverton Circle in Reston back on June 6, 1995, according to a  report  from the Fairfax County Police Department. Police got a major break in the case on Aug. 25, when DNA evidence \"confirmed an investigative lead our detectives had been pursuing,\" the report states. Using that evidence along with additional information uncovered by detectives, they identified Lovchik as a suspect. Lovchick used to reside in Springfield before he moved to Florida in September. Lovchik faces a host of serious charges. He's been charged with fugitive from justice, and he will eventually be charged with armed burglary, abduction with intent to defile, and sodomy, police say. He is expected to face those additional charges once extradited back to Fairfax County, and more charges could be coming. \"The team of men and woman who have been working this case have put in a tremendous amount of work,\" Capt. David Smith of the Fairfax County Police Major Crimes Bureau said in the report. \"As a result of their dedication, we have taken this predator off the street.\" Police ask anyone with additional information on Lovchik, including other potential victims, to call 703-246-4623.

{"story_id":521,"story_clean":"A Morris Plains man was arrested for allegedly calling in threats to a college in Washington state last month, Morris County Prosecutor Fredrick M. Knapp said in a statement. Robert W. Kerekes Jr., 53, is accused of calling in threats to Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington on June 2. As a result, the college was shut down on June 2 and June 3, Knapp said. State and local law enforcement in Washington responded to the college during the threats, according to Knapp. Kerekes allegedly called the Thurston County, Washington 911 center on June 1 and said:  Evergreen State has been the focus of conservative and leftist activists recently. Each year, the college hosts a \"day of absence\" for students and faculty of color; the day is meant to symbolize how important people of color are to the campus. This year, campus activists instead asked white students and faculty to leave campus. In response, Bret Weinstein, a biology instructor, wrote an email calling the request \"an act of oppression\" against whites. Weinstein later appeared on Tucker Carlson's show on Fox News to defend himself. Other conservative media outlets picked up the story as an example of on-campus censorship.

{"story_id":15,"story_clean":"\u00a0 UPDATED: 8 p.m. One of two men wanted in connection with a suspected methamphetamine lab in Northeast Bethlehem that exploded and caught fire turned himself Thursday morning, Bethlehem police said. Jeffrey Caulfield, 28, is the third person connected with the alleged meth lab at 1965 Greenleaf St. to be arrested. Police have a warrant for Caulfield in which he is charged with operating a meth lab, criminal conspiracy, causing a catastrophe and five other crimes. Police have already arrested the house's owner, Elaine M. Noone, 64, and one alleged accomplice, 39, of  Palmer Township . Caulfield was arraigned before District Judge James Narlesky in Hanover Township and then committed to Northampton County Prison in lieu of $100,000 bail. A fourth alleged co-conspirator, Daniel James Houser, 39, remains at large. On Tuesday, police released a photo of Houser. However, police noted that he no longer has a ponytail and has suffered burns to his face, lips, arms and right leg as a result of the March 8 explosion and fire at the alleged meth lab.

{"story_id":1181,"story_clean":"Lewd acts with a minor and other felony charges were filed Friday against a Temecula man accused of molesting his 6-year-old relative. Dana Leon Wilber, 50, was arrested and booked Wednesday into the Byrd Detention Center in French Valley on suspicion of felony sex charges, with bail set at $1 million, records show. According to Riverside County sheriff's Sgt. Steve Fredericks, earlier this month, detectives received a report that Wilber had allegedly sexually abused the young victim, sparking an investigation. \"The victim's mother immediately removed the suspect's access to the victim upon learning of the sexual abuse,\" Fredericks said in a news release.  Detectives conducted interviews and gathered evidence over a two-week span, eventually obtaining a warrant for Wilber's arrest. \"On [Monday], detectives located the suspect at his place of employment in the city of Riverside and placed him under arrest,\" the sergeant said.  Wilber has no prior documented felony convictions. Court records show he was charged with one count of committing a lewd act with a child under 14 and two counts of engaging in oral copulation or sexual penetration with a child under 10. He was expected in court on Friday. \u2014 City News Service contributed to this report \/ Image via Riverside County Sheriff's Department","author_belief":null,"author_belief_highlight":null,"suspect_committedCrime":72.0,"suspect_committedCrime_highlight":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.1666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667]}
{"story_id":1065,"story_clean":"Five teenagers were arrested Saturday after they allegedly stole a bag from a woman at the Trumbull Mall and led police on a high speed chase in a stolen car on Rte. 25. Police say the incident began when a mall employee reportes someone stole a bag from her as she sat in her car during her lunch break.  Police say a 16-year-old Waterbury teen took the bag and ran into an awaiting BMW SUV, which was reported stolen out of New Canaan. Police say the SUV nearly hit several vehicles as it left the mall parking lot.  An off-duty Trumbull officer spotted the BMW, and another officer tried to stop it on Main Street into Bridgeport. The chase continued until Trumbull, Bridgeport and State Police were able to stop the car near the Daniels Farm Road exit.  Four of the suspects in the car were juveniles. Police also arrested 18-year-old Johnny Aspiliare of Hartford and charged him with larceny in the first degree, conspiracy to commit robbery and interfering with an officer. He was held on a $10,00 bond.  The four remaining teens were from Waterbury. Three were released to parents and a 16-year-old from Waterbury was found to have an active arrest warrant out of Waterbury and was turned over to that department.

Vince Martinez said. \"After checking several doors, he found one unlocked and went inside.\" Officers dispatched at 12:12 a.m. to the 900 block of Main Street regarding a report of a man inside a resident's apartment reported that a resident was alone and asleep in his room, when he heard someone walk inside.

{"story_id":764,"story_clean":"Agents with the ATF don't file many criminal complaints at the Will County Courthouse but last week was an exception. The ATF, with assistance of Bolingbrook's Police Department, captured two men suspected of distributing a large amount of marijuana, as well as heroin. The criminal complaint charges co-defendants  Angel Cardenas-Rivera , 24, of Stickney, Illinois, and 27-year-old  Juan Romo  of Romoland, California, in Will County Circuit Court with unlawful delivery of a controlled substance, a class X felony, and unlawful possession of cannabis with intent to delivery, also a Class X felony. One criminal count alleges that Romo and Cardenas-Rivera, on June 5, \"knowingly and unlawfully possessed with intent to deliver more than 5,000 grams of any substance containing cannabis.\" The second count alleges that back on Nov. 7, 2017, the pair \"delivered 15 grams or more, but less than 100 grams of a substance containing heroin, a controlled substance.\" Patch reached out to Bolingbrook Police since Bolingbrook was listed at the jail as the arresting agency. However, Bolingbrook officials noted that they were only a secondary agency assisting on the case. In any event, Romo's bail was set by a Will County judge at $200,000 while Cardenas-Rivera got a $250,000 bail. Rivera has remained incarcerated since the early morning hours of June 6.

{"story_id":217,"story_clean":"A Boston man accused of robbing multiple banks in communities on Route 128 is set to appear in court. Paul B. Landrum, dubbed the \"Route 128 bandit,\" is scheduled to appear in U.S. District Court in Boston Friday at 10:15 a.m. On Wednesday, he was charged with bank robbery. Authorities say Landrum is responsible for nine bank robberies that took place in Greater Boston. In each case, witnesses described the suspect as a 30-45-year-old light-skinned black or Hispanic male wearing a baseball hat, sunglasses and a long-sleeved collarless shirt.

{"story_id":1077,"story_clean":"Four men pulled over in a traffic stop connected to a drug heist were arrested Sunday night on suspicion of stealing more than 10 pounds of marijuana from a residence in Moraga.  A possible burglary was reported in the 100 block of Donald Drive just before 9:30 p.m., and the reporting party described the suspects as three or four men wearing hooded sweatshirts and armed with baseball bats. At least one of them was allegedly spotted with a gun. A suspect vehicle was identified and stopped in the vicinity of Moraga Road and Moraga Way. Responding officers found four men inside wearing hooded sweatshirts. They also allegedly found a baseball bat, a loaded handgun that turned out to be stolen, and a large quantity of marijuana  measured in excess of 10 pounds.  Investigators believe one of the suspects had purchased a large quantity of marijuana at the victim's residence at some point in the past, then returned with accomplices to steal more of it.

{"story_id":879,"story_clean":"At least three women reported being \"flashed\" while riding Orange County Transit Authority buses, recently. On Thursday, a 48-year-old Costa Mesa man was behind bars on charges of exposing himself. Three women, including a teenager, suffered the indignity of being \"flashed\" while riding OCTA buses across the county, and authorities suspect there may be additional victims. Carlos Alberto Tirado, who is charged with three misdemeanor counts of indecent exposure and a single misdemeanor count of child annoyance, was arrested June 29 and is being held in lieu of $35,000 bail, according to Orange County Jail records. He's next due in court July 13 for a pretrial hearing. About 1:30 p.m. on June 19, Orange County sheriff's deputies responded to a report that the suspect was exposing and touching himself on a bus near Highland and Bristol streets in Santa Ana while sitting near a 16-year-old girl, according to Carrie Braun of the Orange County Sheriff's Department. A sheriff's investigator reviewing bus surveillance footage recognized Tirado was a suspect arrested Feb. 20 for a similar flashing incident on an OCTA bus in Anaheim, Braun said. In that case, he allegedly exposed himself to a 22-year-old woman aboard a bus near State college Boulevard and La Palma Avenue, she said. He was arrested March 17 on suspicion of indecent exposure, but he bailed out of jail and was awaiting a court date at the time of the alleged June 29 crime, Braun said. Tirado is also accused of exposing and touching himself last Dec. 10 while making eye contact with a 22-year-old woman on an OCTA bus in Anaheim, she said. Sheriff's investigators asked anyone with information to call deputies at (714) 265-4340. Orange County Crime Stoppers accepts anonymous tips at (855) TIP-OCCS.

{"story_id":338,"story_clean":"A grand jury in Barnstable County has indicted the man accused of killing Yarmouth Police Officer Sean Gannon on multiple charges, including murder. Authorities say 29-year-old \"career criminal\" Thomas Latanowich shot and killed Gannon April 12 as Gannon, his K-9 Nero and six Barnstable and Yarmouth officers tried to arrest him at a Blueberry Lane residence in Marstons Mills.  Investigators believe Latanowich was hiding behind insulation in the attic of the home and shot Gannon and Nero after Gannon removed it. He then allegedly disassembled the gun and threw bullets in the toilet as officers closed in on him.  Latanowich ultimately surrendered to police. Gannon, who was shot in the head, was later pronounced dead at the hospital. Nero recovered from his injuries.  Latanowich had over 100 charges at the time of the killing. He has now been indicted on charges of murder, aggravated assault with a dangerous weapon, use of a firearm in the commission of a felony, possession of a firearm without a license and carrying a loaded weapon without a license, mistreating a police dog and armed career criminal,  according to 7-News .

{"story_id":296,"story_clean":"A felon suspected of shooting a West Covina police officer last month was charged Wednesday with attempted murder of a peace officer. Jose R. Chavez, 47, is scheduled to be arraigned Thursday at the West Covina courthouse on the attempted murder charge, along with one felony count each of assault on a peace officer with a semiautomatic firearm and being a felon in possession of a firearm. The criminal complaint includes gun and gang allegations, along with an allegation that Chavez had been released from custody on bail or his own recognizance in a drug case. Chavez was arrested in La Puente just after 2 a.m. last Thursday by a sheriff's SWAT team and taken to a hospital to be treated for injuries he suffered in the May 20 gunbattle. He is accused of shooting West Covina police Officer Kenny Benitez in the upper body about 11:20 p.m. May 20 near the intersection of North Yaleton Avenue and Badillo Street. \"Chavez fired numerous rounds at the officer as the officer attempted to detain him,\" Deputy Sara Rodriguez of the Sheriff's Information Bureau said last month. According to sheriff's homicide detectives assisting West Covina police with the officer-involved shooting investigation, Benitez had \"contacted\" a man riding a bicycle, which left to a gunfight between the officer and the cyclist, according to Deputy Trina Schrader. Benitez was hospitalized, but has since been released. It's unclear what led to the escalation after the initial contact was made by Benitez or why the officer initially stopped the man. -- City News Service, photo courtesy of the

{"story_id":1276,"story_clean":"Orland Park police arrested a woman they said stole wallets from customers at two different Panera Bread locations in the village over the last two months.  Star Davis, 47, of Chicago has been involved in \"a litany of pick pocket thefts\" from customers at the Panera locations, one at 15845 Harlem Ave. and the other at 15252 S. Lagrange Road.  Police said that on Feb. 13 Davis stole a wallet from a customer at the Harlem Avenue location and involved \"several co-conspirators\" in using the victim's credit cards at a Kohl's in Orland Park, a Target in Tinley Park and a Walmart in Orland Hills.  Davis is also accused of stealing a wallet from a customer at the Lagrange Road location on March 29 and using the co-conspirators to use the victim's credit cards at the Apple store in Orland Square Mall and the Target in Tinley Park.  The next day, Davis was arrested at her home in Chicago's West Englewood neighborhood. Police said she is \"well known in the law enforcement community\" for her involvement in pick pocket thefts and was on home monitoring at the time of her arrest. She was charged with continuing a criminal financial enterprise and identity theft.  A search of her residence recovered a wallet and credit cards taken in a theft at Panera the day prior, police said.  Davis is not the only pick pocket crew leader in the area, police warned. She is suspected in several other instances but has been ruled out in other cases.

{"story_id":1486,"story_clean":"Six felony charges of lewd acts on a child were filed Thursday against a 34-year-old East County man accused of sexually assaulting an underage girl. Shaun Crocker, also known as Shawn Hedge Crocker, according to a criminal complaint, is accused of touching the victim inappropriately on various occasions between September and November of last year. According to KGTV, Crocker is the son of Matthew Hedge, a convicted sex offender who made headlines not only for his child molestation convictions, but also a judge's controversial decision to lift Hedge's sexually violent predator status and release him from custody without supervision. KGTV cites statements from the alleged victim's mother regarding Crocker's parentage, though the District Attorney's office has not confirmed the relation. Crocker, who faces 18 years in prison if convicted of all charges, was arrested Wednesday and remains in custody on $1 million bail, according to county jail records. He's next due in court Aug. 16. Hedge pleaded guilty in 1989 to molesting four children in the San Diego area and served 12 years in prison. He was committed to the sexually violent predator treatment program in 1997, but was released into outpatient treatment in 2005 in a trailer outside Donovan State Prison in Otay Mesa. His outpatient status was revoked within six weeks for violating terms of his release. After more than two years of in-patient hospital treatment, the court in October 2008 again granted Hedge's petition to be placed in outpatient treatment. In 2012, he was released without supervision after San Diego Superior Court Judge David Gill determined he no longer posed a danger to others and was unlikely to re-offend. \u2013 City News Service","author_belief":78.2,"author_belief_highlight":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.3,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2],"suspect_committedCrime":86.4,"suspect_committedCrime_highlight":[0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}
{"story_id":456,"story_clean":"A man was arrested for allegedly attacking a homeless man in what police are investigating as a suspected hate crime in Georgetown.  Richard Walter Moore, 40, was arrested on an assault charge for the incident that occurred on the corner of Wisconsin Avenue and M Street at about 1 p.m. Thursday, Nov. 2.  Moore, a white man, allegedly attacked the black victim who was panhandling on the corner. Police said Moore called the victim racial slurs and told him to leave the corner he was sitting at.  The victim walked away from the corner and Moore followed him to an alley in the 1000 block of Wisconsin Ave, NW, police said. Moore then allegedly punched and kicked the man, and picked up a metal railing plant holder and struck him, police said. The victim was treated at the scene for non-life threatening injuries.  Police said they are investigating this incident as a hate or bias crime.  \"The designation can be changed at any point as an investigation proceeds and more information is gathered. A designation as a hate crime by MPD does not mean that prosecutors will prosecute it as a hate crime,\" police said in a statement.  Moore, of no fixed address, was charged with Assault with a Dangerous Weapon.

At a King County District Court on Tuesday, Aug. 20, bail was set at $250,000 for a former Shoreline Police Officer of the year who is accused of theft, evidence tampering, and possession of stolen property. Mitch Wright, 33 years old and a\u00a010-year veteran of the King County Sheriff's Office, was arrested Monday morning, Aug. 19,\u00a0on\u00a0multiple charges at his Bothell area home,\u00a0according to Cindi West of the King County Sheriff's Office. In 2006, Wright was named Shoreline Police Officer of the year, and according to the department's annual report, during that year\u00a0he made more than 150 arrests, including numerous arrests of suspects in stolen cars, felony narcotics violations, and other serious crimes.\u00a0 Wright was booked into the King County Jail on several charges, including:\u00a0Investigation of Theft, Possession of Stolen Property, Tampering, and Possession of a Controlled Substance.\u00a0 According to a report in the Seattle Times,  Wright is accused of failing to turn any of the drugs he was responsible for logging in during the course of\u00a0an undercover operation with the Drug Enforcement Administration.

Ryan Gregory Hollebon, 38, of the 1700 block of Carry Place in Crofton, is accused of violently attacking  Jhalandia Elaine Butler , 28, of the same address, Sunday night. Butler was pronounced dead at the scene. Anne Arundel County Police received a call about domestic violence about 9:24 p.m. Sunday, March 5, at the house in the 1700 block of Carry Place in Crofton. Officers arrived at the scene to find Butler lying inside the residence, while Hollebon had fled. He was taken into custody Monday in the 1300 block of East Patapsco Avenue in Baltimore City, police said. Multiple Anne Arundel County residents alerted police with tips and possible sightings of Hollebon that were followed up on, authorities said. An arrest warrant charged Hollebon with first-degree murder, second-degree murder, first-degree assault, second-degree assault and deadly weapon with intent to injure in Butler's death. On Monday, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner performed an autopsy on Butler and ruled the cause of death was multiple sharped-edge wounds coupled with blunt force trauma and the manner was homicide.

{"story_id":202,"story_clean":"A 74-year-old Springfield man was arrested Saturday on 33 counts of theft, forgery and possession of a forged instrument. His alleged crime? Stealing cold sore medicine and returning it for cash at Bi-Mart stores. His take? Roughly $4,281.  Oregon State Police say they began investigating Terrence Lee Liddell in July after a trooper pulled him over for an unspecified traffic violation and found evidence of apparent shoplifting.  Over a two-month investigation, during which detectives obtained surveillance video and warrants to search Liddell's personal computer, Oregon State Police reportedly discovered evidence Liddell had been stealing Abreva cold sore medication and returning it to Bi-Marts in Oregon and Washington. When investigators interviewed him Sept. 23, Liddell reportedly admitted to the accusations and showed police the printer and stolen Bi-Mart printer paper he used to make the forged return receipts. Liddell was lodged at the Lane County Jail but has since been released.

{"story_id":162,"story_clean":"A 40-year-old homeless man has been accused of sexually assaulting a homeless woman in southwest Miami-Dade and attempting to sexually assault another. Police fear there may be other victims. Lyndon Merlick Nicaisse was charged with sexual battery and attempted sexual battery stemming from the two incidents that occurred between 2:30 a.m. and 5 a.m. on July 27 and July 28. \"Nicaisse is homeless and known to frequent the area of the South Miami-Dade Busway and Southwest 160th Street,\" according to Detective Argemis Colome of the Miami-Dade Police Department, who said that police are asking other possible victims to come forward. Colome said that both victims were sleeping when Nicaisse allegedly assaulted one of them and attempted to assault the other.  One of the victims told police that she awoke to find Nicaisse straddling her body with his penis exposed. He allegedly attempted to pull her pants down, and allegedly told her that he was going to have sex with her. The victim struck her attacker and he ran away, according to police. The other woman was sleeping in a parking lot near the busway when Nicaisse allegedly laid down beside her, pulled her pants down and allegedly sexually assaulted her. \"The victim was able to push Nicaisse and ran to a nearby restaurant to call police,\" Colome said. \"Uniform officers responded to the scene and located Nicaisse, where he was positively identified by the victim and arrested.\" The case was investigated by the Miami-Dade Police Department Special Victims Bureau.

{"story_id":1580,"story_clean":"The man accused of gunning down a man in Haverford Township this summer, appeared in court Thursday and will now head to a trial to face numerous charges related to the seemingly senseless killing. Derrick Hershal Rollins, 24, of Philadelphia, had all charges filed against him in connection with 29-year-old John Le's July slaying held over for trial at his preliminary hearing on Thursday, Oct. 26, court records show. Rollins will go on to face charges of criminal homicide; first, second, and third degree murder; aggravated assault; prohibited possession of a firearm; robbery; and more in connection with the killing that stunned the quiet Main Line community. His formal arraignment is set for Nov. 9 in a Delaware County court and he remains behind bars as he was not granted bail. The fatal shooting occurred at about 6 p.m. Saturday, July 28 at an apartment on the 2300 block of Haverford Road in the Ardmore section of the township. Le, of Narberth, was reportedly walking to a friend's home with a pizza when he was shot. About 45 minutes before Le's death, Rollins also allegedly fired numerous rounds at two men in Philadelphia's Overbrook neighborhood who said they confronted Rollins as he was peering into a neighbors' home. According to Main Line Media News, a  Haverford Township Police Detective and one of the men Rollins allegedly shot at in Overbrook spoke as witnesses at Thursday's hearing. Rollins,  who was taken into custody in Dekalb County, Georgia in late August  after multiple law enforcement agencies including U.S. Marshals issued an alert for his arrest, allegedly told the detective that the media made him a \"monster\" and that he ran from the shooting scene like everyone else did.

{"story_id":566,"story_clean":"A Perris man is behind bars Tuesday, accused of a bizarre series of events that included breaking into a Lake Elsinore business to burglarize the place and then lighting fires inside.  Riverside County officials say that they were called to the 2400 Block of East Lakeshore Avenue around 8 a.m. Monday for a \"commercial burglary occurring at a business.\"  \"Officers arrived and found the business was forcibly broken into and located a suspect inside,\" police said in a news release. \"The suspect was hiding in the attic of the building and was starting fires.\"  Police officers said they tried to arrest the man, identified as 46-year-old Jodie Meza. However, he \"refused and attempted to hang himself.\"  Law enforcement rushed to rescue Meza, took him out of the attic and firefighters doused the blaze, sheriff's officials said. Then, while he was being detained, Meza allegedly attacked an officer.  Meza was treated at an area hospital and then taken to the Cois Byrd Detention Center in French Valley, the sheriff's department said.

{"story_id":1022,"story_clean":"Deonte Taylor, a Walnut Grove Elementary School teacher, has been charged with three counts of first-degree statutory sodomy for a sexual assault that prosecutors say happened when he was a teacher's assistant at Lusher Elementary School in the nearby Hazelwood School District. Authorities say the assault happened in November 2015. Taylor is accused of pulling a 7-year-old student out of class and sodomizing him in an empty room. Prosecutors say they have DNA evidence linking Taylor to the assault.   The boy reported the assault in 2015, but police didn't arrest Taylor until Thursday, more than three years later. The Post-Dispatch reports  Taylor was placed on leave and subsequently fired for unrelated reasons  after the allegations came to light in Hazelwood, but parents weren't notified and Taylor was later rehired in by the Ferguson-Florissant School District. \"The district would not knowingly hire a potential employee who had a record of or had committed crimes against children,\" the district wrote in a prepared statement. The district says it conducted a background check and that Taylor had no criminal history, but it's not clear how the allegation \u2014 which was included in his file from Hazelwood, according to a Hazelwood district spokesperson \u2014 slipped by in the hiring process.

{"story_id":1026,"story_clean":"Detectives in Orange County arrested three people suspected of pulling off a scheme to steal jewelry from real estate open houses across the county, including homes in San Clemente, Anaheim and Ladera Ranch. The trio, a man and two women, allegedly nabbed more than $20,000 in jewelry from unsuspecting home owners. Authorities were able to get back thousands of dollars worth of stolen items. Detectives also found a ledger complete with the details of scheduled open houses in Orange, San Diego and Los Angeles counties, said Jaimee Blashaw of the sheriff's department. All three suspects are residents of Los Angeles. Nino Siganoff, 33, Valerie Siganoff, 36, and Barbara Adams, 29, were arrested Tuesday on suspicion of felony burglary. \"Investigators believe the suspects started running the scheme in October,\" said Jaimee Blashaw of the sheriff's department. \"A male suspect would distract the real estate agent, while two female suspects would search other areas of the home and steal items.\" Investigators believe the $20,000 worth of items recovered are from homes in Ladera Ranch, San Clemente and Anaheim, Blashaw said.  \"While a portion of the recovered property has been returned to some of the victims, the property reunification process is ongoing,\" Blashaw said. \"Sheriff's investigators also believe there are potentially more victims of this scheme.\" Authorities released photos of recovered items, and urged possible victims to call investigators at (949) 206-6100.

{"story_id":1586,"story_clean":"The man accused of robbing the TD Bank in Peabody back in November was arrested Monday. Jason S. Englen, 34, of Chelsea is charged with the Peabody robbery; as well as robberies in Arlington, Reading and Burlingon. According to the U.S. Attorney's office, a suspect identified as Englen first entered the TD Bank in Arlington on Oct. 31, approached a teller and presented a note with the word \"Robery\" written on it. The teller handed him money from the drawer and he fled the bank. The U.S. Attorney's office indicates that nearly identical incidents occurred in Reading, Burlington and Peabody. During each of the incidents, the man handed the teller a note with the word \"Robery\" or \"Robert\" demanding cash. He allegedly  robbed the TD Bank at 79 Lynnfield St. in November . The FBI dubbed the suspect the \"Spelling Bee Bandit\" due to the misspelled notes that were passed to tellers. After each of the alleged incidents, surveillance pictures were circulated across the state. Authorities were able to identify Englen as the suspect of the robberies, and learned that Englen was already in state custody on unrelated charges. If convicted, Englen could face a sentence of up to 20 years and prison, three years supervised lease, and a fine of $250,000.

{"story_id":206,"story_clean":"A Bayside man is accused of stealing more than $35,000 from a Long Island church while serving as the church's treasurer. Ronald Ousman, 38, surrendered Tuesday morning to DA investigators and was arraigned on a third degree grand larceny charge, Acting Nassau County District Attorney Madeline Singas said. Ousman allegedly stole $35,608 from Holy Trinity Orthodox Church, located at 369 Green Avenue in East Meadow, from May 16, 2014 until May 7, 2015. Ousman made a series of cash withdrawals from the church's checking and money market accounts, Singas said. The investigation began when church officials contacted the Internal Revenue Service to verify certain tax information, Singas said. IRS employees informed church officials that certain payments were never received by the IRS and an investigation was opened by the DA's office in May. \"The defendant was a trusted member of the faith community, but is charged with taking advantage of that trust by stealing more than $35,000 from a house of worship,\" Singas said. \"I thank church officials for bringing this alleged theft to our attention and encourage members of the public to reach out to my office if they suspect a crime has taken place.\" Ousman faces up to seven years in prison if convicted. He was was released on his own recognizance Tuesday and is due back in court on Sept. 15.","author_belief":61.8,"author_belief_highlight":[0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0],"suspect_committedCrime":80.0,"suspect_committedCrime_highlight":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

{"story_id":776,"story_clean":"An 18-year-old man accused of\u00a0of raping a clerk at an El Monte convenience store was expected to be arraigned tomorrow at Pomona Superior Court. Joseph Leo Amaya is charged with two counts of forcible rape and three counts of sexual penetration by a foreign object. The charges include an allegation that he kidnapped the victim, a 19-year-old college student, to commit those crimes. Amaya allegedly approached the victim as she was working the night shift at the Peck Mini Mart at 4164 N. Peck Road. He left the store, but allegedly returned when the clerk was getting ready to close up. As she tried to lock the doors, Amaya forced his way back in, barricaded the entrance and dragged the young woman to the back of the store, where he repeatedly sexually assaulted her, prosecutors allege.

{"story_id":509,"story_clean":"A Milton man was arrested Friday and charged with federal sex trafficking crimes, the U.S. Attorney's office said. Duhamel Cassagnol, 30, is accused of recruiting and transporting women across state lines to engage in sex acts, knowing that they would be subject to force, fraud or coercion, according to authorities. He also allegedly took women between states to participate in prostitution.  Cassagnol was charged in an indictment with committing sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion; engaging in a conspiracy to commit sex trafficking; and transporting an individual for prostitution. His alleged crimes took place between July 2014 and February 2016, the USAO said.  A Connecticut woman, 23-year-old Geneiva Whaley, was charged in a criminal complaint with transporting an individual for prostitution. Authorities said Whaley knowingly took one of Cassagnol's victims from Massachusetts to Connecticut in October of 2015 for the purpose of prostitution.  Whaley allegedly recruited the woman, who had just been released from a detox facility, and worked with Cassagnol to keep her in various hotels in Connecticut. The pair allegedly gave the woman drugs and prostituted her while she stayed at the hotels, which were in Whaley's name, the USAO said.

{"story_id":1452,"story_clean":"Redlands Unified School District officials released a statement Thursday about the arrest a day earlier of a\u00a0Clement Middle School teacher\u00a0on suspicion of possessing a controlled substance and paraphernalia. Jennifer Tena Krogman, 40, was arrested Wednesday at her home in Beaumont. She was\u00a0cited by Redlands police\u00a0and released early Thursday. She\u00a0could not be reached to comment for this report. Here is the Redlands Unified School District statement, shared with Redlands-Loma Linda Patch by Assistant Superintendent Brad Mason: \"The district has been informed that Jennifer Krogman was arrested on drug related allegations.\u00a0It is the district's policy once those allegations have been confirmed, to place the employee on paid administrative leave upon return to duty from summer break. This continues until the resolution of the criminal charges and the district's internal investigation.\" The\u00a0East Valley Street Enforcement Team, comprised of\u00a0Redlands police and\u00a0San Bernardino County deputies, arrested Krogman at her home in the 1600 block of Apollo Way in Beaumont around 3 p.m. July 31, Redlands police Lt.

{"story_id":92,"story_clean":"A 25-year-old Bronx, NY woman was arrested on charges of forgery and identity theft after she allegedly tried to cash a fraudulent check for $4,532 at TD Banks in Darien, Greenwich and Stamford, according to Darien police. Kashai Princess George was charged with criminal impersonation, first-degree forgery and third-degree identity theft when she was apprehended on March 3 at the TD Bank on the Post Road in Darien. Officers were dispatched to the bank following a report of a woman trying to cash a fraudulent check, who turned out to be the same woman who tried to cash checks in the other mentioned towns. To cash the checks, George allegedly had used a NY driver's license bearing the name \"Sarojni Basil.\" \"When asked if the information she had given to the bank was hers, George admitted that it was not. She stated that the driver's license had someone else's information with her (George's) picture,\" wrote Darien police in a statement. \"Based on the above, George was placed under arrest. \"In speaking with bank employees, they informed officers that they had been sent an internal notice about the suspect as she had gone to branches in Greenwich and Stamford attempting to get account information and cash checks under the name Sarojni Basil.\" A teller at the Darien branch had immediately recognized the name George was using and notified a co-worker.

{"story_id":898,"story_clean":"Authorities have arrested a man who allegedly was part of a group that assaulted an off-duty Newark police officer on Tuesday. According to the Newark Department of Public Safety, the officer got into a collision with another driver around 11:05 p.m. near Bloomfield and Mount Prospect Avenues. When he saw someone on the ground, the officer got out of his vehicle. At that point, a group of men allegedly assaulted him and took his cell phone, even though he repeatedly told them that he was a police officer. The driver of the other car managed to run to safety during the assault, police said. After the assault, the injured officer's on-duty peers arrived on the scene to lend aid. Emergency responders transported him to University Hospital for treatment, authorities said. After conducting an investigation, Newark detectives identified Geraldo Concepcion, 27, of Newark, one of the suspects who allegedly attacked and robbed the officer. Police arrested Concepcion on Wednesday and charged him with aggravated assault and conspiracy. (See below photo) \"Several other suspects remain at large as this investigation continues,\" the Newark Department of Public Safety stated Wednesday. \"While police are actively searching for other suspects, we seek the public's assistance in quickly locating and removing them from our streets.\" Anyone with information can call the department's 24-hour Crime Stopper tip line at 1-877-NWK-TIPS (1-877-695-8477) or 1-877-NWK-GUNS (1-877-695-4867).

{"story_id":242,"story_clean":"A Centereach woman who was employed as a nurse at  Medford Multicare Center for Living  is accused of falsifying medical records and taking painkillers from the nursing home for her own personal use.  Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced the arrest of 32-year-old Nicholle Gavegli on Wednesday.  Authorities say Gavegli claimed to have administered multiple prescribed Percocet tablets to a nursing home resident from Medford when she did not actually do so. Gavegli instead kept the pills for her own unauthorized use, Schneiderman said.  \"All nursing home employees have a solemn responsibility to properly care for their patients, including ensuring that they receive prescribed medications,\" Schneiderman said. \"The falsification of medical records and theft of drugs \u2013 especially dangerous and addictive prescription narcotics \u2013 will not be tolerated by my office.\" Gaveglia has been a licensed practical nurse since 2005. According to the Attorney General's felony complaint, from June 9 - July 27, 2014, while working as a medication nurse and caring for residents at the nursing home located at 3115 Horseblock Road, Gaveglia allegedly falsely recorded in a resident's medical records that she administered the Percocet tablets.  Gaveglia allegedly later admitted to falsifying the records to cover up her theft and illegal possession of the drugs. She is charged with first degree falsifying business records, seventh degree criminal possession of a controlled substance and petty larceny.  Gaveglia was arraigned before before Judge Pierce Cohalon in First District Court in Central Islip on Wednesday. The case was adjourned for a conference on July 15 in the same court.

{"story_id":316,"story_clean":"A former Wayne State University student faces five criminal charges, including felony counts of video voyeurism and using a computer to commit a crime, after he allegedly spied on students with  a hidden video camera as they used a restroom  in a campus building. A man using a restroom in State Hall last September spotted the recording device, which was in a backpack positioned between two stalls, and alerted police, the Detroit Free Press reports. The suspect was immediately arrested, and was criminally charged this month. He hadn't been enrolled at the university in more than a year, Wayne State spokesman Matt Lockwood said in a statement. It's unclear  how many people were recorded while using the stalls , Wayne State University Police Chief Dave Spencer told WJBK-TV. Spencer said that in 30 years as a campus police officer, he's never encountered anything like this. Authorities didn't divulge what kind of device was being used, but it wasn't a cell phone camera, according to the WJBK-TV report. Also on Patch: Students interviewed by WJBK-TV said they were unaware of the alleged video voyeurism. Because the suspect was immediately taken into custody, university officials determined there was no imminent threat to students, so they didn't issue a mass email or text message, police said. Lockwood said the university is taking the matter seriously. \"We feel for the victims of this invasion of privacy and do not tolerate such criminal behavior,\" he said. __________ Photo via

{"story_id":601,"story_clean":"A Revere man was arrested this week in connection with a series of package thefts in Chelmsford. David Gomez, 25, was found with LSD during his arrest and charged with a host of crimes. He is also a suspect in a series of similar package thefts in Wenham. Chelmsford police Chief James Spinney said officers were alerted to Gomez Tuesday by a Berkley Drive resident who reported the suspect stole an envelope out of a mailbox. Officer found Gomez nearby in a white van, Spinney said. \"Officers found a cardboard box in the front passenger's seat with multiple items inside,\" Spinney said in a statement. \"Officers seized several Christmas cards, envelopes addressed to sanitation and recycling workers and packages from the vehicle. The cards were addressed to several addresses in both Chelmsford and Wenham.\" Spinney continued, \"Also in the van, a pill bottle was found with what is believed to be a dose of the psychedelic drug LSD inside. In GOMEZ'S pockets, police found $505 in cash that had allegedly been taken from numerous cards and multiple gift cards.\" Chelmsford police charged Gomez with receiving stolen property over $250, larceny over $250 and drug possession. Wenham police are investigating Gomez and could issue charges.

{"story_id":1298,"story_clean":"Photos courtesy of San Diego County Sheriff''s Department Authorities Tuesday sought the public's help in identifying and finding a man who allegedly pulled a teenager partially into his truck, dragged her along and threw her cell phone at her, because she began recording him when he made sexual comments to her. The incident occurred about 1 p.m. July 10 in the 8700 block of Mesa Drive, as the 18-year-old woman walked down the street, officials said. A man driving a white truck began making comments about the woman's sexuality, officials said. The woman approached the truck and began video recording the male driver with her cell phone, according to sheriff's officials. The man grabbed the woman's arm and phone, pulling her partially into the window of the truck; he then accelerated his truck and dragged the woman several feet along the roadway, officials said. When he stopped the truck abruptly, the woman fell, then the man threw the woman's phone at her, hitting her left temple, sheriff's officials reported. The teen suffered scrapes and bruises during the encounter.  The victim believes that the vehicle the suspect was drove a two-door Ford Ranger truck with a ladder on top.  The truck also has small purple stripes running the length of the sides. It is possible that the suspect lives in the area of Mesa Road and Prospect Avenue in Santee, officials said.  The suspect is between 40 and 50 years old with a goatee.

{"story_id":167,"story_clean":"A 42-year-old Clearwater man faces a number of criminal charges after Hillsborough County deputies say he spied on a woman in her bedroom and bathroom using a camera and also used the webcam on her laptop computer to capture images of her. The arrest of Joshua Fallon was announced by the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office Wednesday following an investigation that kicked off in October 2015. Deputies aren't saying where in Hillsborough County the alleged voyeurism occurred, but said Fallon's recordings revealed more than one victim. \"Detectives also discovered two other females caught on video in various situations where there would be an expectation of privacy,\" an email from the sheriff's office said. \"Video was recovered that showed the suspect sneaking into the bedroom of one female victim while she slept and he removed her underwear exposing her and touching her while she slept and she was unaware.\" Some of the video footage dates back to 2013, the sheriff's office said. Fallon reportedly lived in Hillsborough County at that time. Deputies say Fallon knew all the victims. Fallon was brought into custody at his workplace in Pinellas County on Wednesday. He now faces one count of sexual battery, seven counts of video voyeurism and three counts of interception of oral communication, the sheriff's office reported.

{"story_id":841,"story_clean":"An intoxicated man recently parked his car in the middle of Route 23 and then began fighting with police when they arrived, authorities said. The incident occurred on Dec. 28 at around 10:34 p.m. near the intersection with Route 113, police said. The suspected, a 45-year-old man from Schuylkill Township, was sitting inside his parked car when officers arrived.  Police said as soon as they tried to administer a field sobriety test, the man began trying to fight them off.  Police then arrested the man and took him to Phoenixville Hospital for blood tests, they said.

{"story_id":1155,"story_clean":"It was another fairly safe week in our fair city, according to the police blotter. That's not to say there were no arrests or citations, but most involved suspected possession of or being under the influence of a controlled substance rather than violent crimes. Of those, at least two were arrests of people driving a car and one was of a person riding a bicycle who were suspected of doing so while under the influence.

{"story_id":1268,"story_clean":"One person has been arrested and Dearborn police are still looking for a second suspect in last week's  attempted break-in at the Arab American News as clearly visible staff members worked  to meet, police said. Stay Connected Deandre Darnell Bey, 20, was arraigned Thursday in 19th District Court on several felonies, including attempted breaking and entering, larceny from a vehicle, malicious destruction of property and possession of burglary tools. Judge Mark W. Somers set bond at $25,000. His release is conditional on the requirement that he wear a GPS tether. Related Bey and a second suspect, who has been identified, allegedly tried to break into the Arab American News, located on Chase Road, just north of Ford Road, about 2 a.m. on March 11.  Surveillance video shows the the suspects looking through the glass doors and windows of the office. One of the suspects is seen hitting the door with a hammer four times, damaging the glass. At the time, Dearborn Police Chief Ronald Haddad said the fact that the would-be intruders could clearly see the building was occupied by multiple people was one of the troubling aspects of the attempted break-in. \"What is particularly disturbing about this crime is that brazen suspects made violent efforts to gain entry into the building which was clearly occupied by newspaper staff,\" he said. The motive is unclear, police said. Anyone with information about the whereabouts of the second suspect is asked to call the Dearborn Police Department anonymous tip line at (313) 943-3012 or the Dearborn police suspicious activity line at (313) 943-3030.","author_belief":74.4,"author_belief_highlight":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0],"suspect_committedCrime":91.8,"suspect_committedCrime_highlight":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.8,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}
{"story_id":1591,"story_clean":"The man suspected of robbing the Jungle Room in Cornelius at knifepoint this past December was indicted by a Washington County Grand Jury last month on charges of robbery, theft, and unlawful use of a weapon.  Diego Angel Sanchez-Lopez, 23, is currently being detained on  a U.S. Marshal's hold in Multnomah County . He is ineligible for bail.  Sanchez-Lopez was reportedly arrested by Hillsboro police in connection with a different armed robbery in late May. That charge has been dismissed, according to court records, so Sanchez-Lopez can be tried for his alleged crimes in a U.S. District Court \u2014 which apparently include the robbery in Cornelius that occurred Dec. 16, 2017.

{"story_id":687,"story_clean":"A teacher suspected of having an inappropriate relationship with an underage student at Santa Teresa High School in San Jose has been arrested, East Side Union High School District officials said Thursday.  The instructor, Trudy Hill, 32, was booked into jail on suspicion of sexual assault on a minor and has been placed on leave from the job, district Superintendent Chris Funk said in a statement. The San Jose Police Department said its investigation found that between August 2016 and November 2016, Hill had a sexual relationship with a 17 year-old male student.  \"We are shocked and deeply disturbed by these allegations,\" Funk said. \"We want to assure the community that the safety and well-being of our students is our highest priority,\" he said. The district has cooperated with police and is conducting its own investigation to make sure staff have enough training and resources to prevent future cases of sexual assault, according to Funk. The district is supporting the victimized student and family, Funk said. Hill, a San Jose resident, surrendered Thursday to detectives at San Jose PD, where she posted bail and was released, police said. Charges against the suspect include suspicion of sending harmful matter to a minor and oral copulation, police said. No other victims have been identified.  Anyone with information on the case is asked to call police Detective Sean Pierce of the San Jose PD's Crimes Against Children\/Child Exploitation Detail task force at (408) 537-1397.

{"story_id":958,"story_clean":"Caption: Declan Moore, 19, of Evergreen Park, is accused of breaking into four cars in Oak Lawn, IL. | Cook County Sheriff An Evergreen Park man believed to be a suspect in four car burglaries was grabbed by Oak Lawn police after they found him crouching down next to a vehicle Friday morning, according to a police news release. Declan M. Moore, 19, of the 9700 block of South Avers Avenue, Evergreen Park, was charged with four counts of felony burglary, one count possession of cannabis and one count of drug paraphernalia. The arrest unfolded around 10 a.m. Friday, when police spotted a man later identified as Moore crouched down next to a car in the 9800 block of South Tripp Avenue, police said. According to officers, Moore appeared to be hiding. After confronting Moore, police discovered that he had in his possession several items that came from cars parking in the neighborhood. Police said the owners identified their property as coming from their cars. Moore was taken into custody, who is believed to have allegedly burglarized four vehicles in the immediate area during earlier Friday morning.  The vehicles did not show any signs of forcible entry, police said. The Cook County assistant state's attorney approved felony charges. Moore appeared Saturday in weekend bond court at the George Leighton Criminal Court Building at 26th and California.

{"story_id":190,"story_clean":"A 54-year-old man was arrested late Friday on suspicion of raping his ex-girlfriend at her Rosemont home, according to a recent crime log from the Sacramento County Sheriff's Department. According to the crime log, Donny Ray Bryant forced his way through his ex-girlfriend's window Friday night. The two struggled, and Bryant raped her, the crime log states. The two have had an on-and-off relationship over the past 10 years, and the woman has a restraining order against Bryant, the department said. Bryant is currently being held at the Sacramento County Main Jail on felony charges of rape, burglary and domestic violence, as well as a misdemeanor charge of violating a court order. He is being held on $205,000 bail, and is due in court Tuesday afternoon. Two 17-year-old boys were arrested Wednesday afternoon after allegedly stealing bicycles from younger boys in front of a Kiefer Boulevard convenience store. According to the sheriff's department, two boys were shopping at TS Market, 9408 Kiefer Blvd., while a third watched their bicycles outside. The third boy was approached by two 17-year-olds, who allegedly overpowered him and took two of the bicycles. A father of one of the victims found one of the suspects riding his son's bicycle nearby, and was able to get it back, the department said. Another of the victims found the other suspect riding his bicycle, but the 17-year-old allegedly said he wouldn't return it unless the younger boy forked over some cash.

Investigation of the rash of vandalism led to the identification of a suspect, Thomas Jigme Wheat, a 43-year-old resident of the city, in two of the alleged slashings, police said. Police currently are accusing Wheat of one felony count and one misdemeanor count in connection with the vandalism incidents.  Sonoma County jail records show Wheat was booked into jail at 4:35 p.m. Wednesday. His bail was set at $6,000. The investigation is continuing, police said, with a reward of up to $2,500 offered by Sonoma County Alliance's \"Take Back Our Community Program\" for information leading to the arrest of the suspect or suspects involved in the vandalism incidents. Anyone who thinks they may have witnessed any of the tire slashings reported last Wednesday and Thursday is encouraged to call SRPD's Property Crimes Team at 707-543-3575.

{"story_id":511,"story_clean":"A Minneapolis man was charged with second degree burglary in connection with a Long Lake burglary that was reported on January 26. Three burglaries on Wolf Point Trail in Long Lake that date were the subject of a Crime Alert issued by Wayzata PD. Although only charged with one of the burglaries at this time, it is believed that all three Wolf Pointe Trail burglaries are connected, as well as burglaries in several other western suburbs, including Wayzata. On March 14, Minnetonka Police responded to a residential burglar alarm. The suspect in that attempted burglary was apprehended a short time later and arrested. Details investigators received from that arrest combined with information from Wayzata's investigation led to the execution of two search warrants in North Minneapolis. Property stolen from one of the Wolf Pointe burglaries as well as property from other jurisdiction's burglaries was recovered.\u00a0 The boots allegedly used during the crimes were also seized. Mark Tracy Seaborn, 45, has multiple convictions for burglary and is currently on parole for a burglary conviction. Because of his lengthy criminal history, bail in this case was set at $500,000.

{"story_id":475,"story_clean":"A man who allegedly shot and seriously wounded another man in Desert Hot Springs was charged with attempted murder and assault with a semi-automatic firearm Friday. Carlos Anthony Beltran, 37, is accused in the May 16 shooting of a man in the 66100 block of Second Street. Desert Hot Springs police found the victim \"suffering from a life-threatening gunshot wound,\" and took him to Desert Regional Medical Center in Palm Springs for treatment. Police are not seeking any other suspects in connection with the shooting. Beltran's relationship, if any, to the victim, has not been disclosed. He was taken into custody Wednesday near the intersection of 12th Street and Palm Drive in Desert Hot Springs, according to county jail records, and was being held in lieu of $1 million bail. The arrest was the result of a collaboration between the Desert Hot Springs Police Department and the Riverside County Sheriff's Department's Fugitive Warrant Enforcement Team, according to police. Beltran also faces allegations of causing great bodily injury and committing the crime while out on bail. He was slated to make his initial court appearance Friday afternoon at the Larson Justice Center in Indio. \u2014By City News Service \/ Image via Shutterstock","author_belief":59.4,"author_belief_highlight":[0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0],"suspect_committedCrime":70.0,"suspect_committedCrime_highlight":[0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}
{"story_id":1585,"story_clean":"The man accused of robbing the TD Bank in Arlington back in October was arrested Monday. Jason S. Englen, 34, of Chelsea is charged with the Arlington robbery; as well as robberies in Burlington, Reading and Peabody.  According to the U.S. Attorney's office, a suspect identified as Englen entered the TD Bank in Arlington, approached a teller and presented a note with the word \"Robery\" written on it. The telller handed him money from the drawer and he fled the bank.  \"Investigating this case took time, patience and commitment from all agencies involved,\" Arlington Police Chief Frederick Ryan said. \"I commend Arlington Police for their diligent work and collaboration with the FBI. Together we were able to bring this man to justice for his crimes.\" The U.S. Attorney's office indicates that nearly identical incidents occurred in Reading, Burlington and Peabody. During each of the incidents, the man handed the teller a note with the word \"Robery\" or \"Robert\" demanding cash.  The FBI dubbed the suspect the \"Spelling Bee Bandit\" due to the misspelled notes that were passed to tellers. After each of the alleged incidents, surveillance pictures were circulated across the state.

He said the suspects are accused of targeting children for sexual exploitation.  \"This trap will be laid time and time again until the message reverberates \u2013 don't buy sex in Ohio,\" Yost said. \"Task forces are a force multiplier and their success is evident in the number of criminals taken off the street.\" The suspects come from throughout Northeast Ohio. Each individual was taken into custody over the past three days, Yost said. The investigation into the suspects was led by the Mahoning Valley Human Trafficking Task Force.  All of the suspects face felony charges of importuning, attempted unlawful sexual conduct with a minor and possession of criminal tools. Yost said the suspects are: \"We will continue to do everything in our power to identify and apprehend these individuals before they come in contact with real children,\" said David Frattare, Commander of the ICAC. \"Operations such as these should serve as a reminder that offenders will go to great lengths to exploit popular social media networks and mobile applications to gain access to children for their own sexual gratification.\"  This is the second undercover sting operation this year in the Youngstown area.

{"story_id":22,"story_clean":" A Laguna Hills woman was immediately sentenced to 16 months in prison today after pleading guilty for planting weapons and drugs in another woman's truck in an effort to get her arrested.  37-year-old Jennifer Michele Beale who has been in custody since her arrest April 14, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit a crime, false imprisonment -- both felonies -- and misdemeanor counts of making a false report of an emergency and altering evidence.  Kevin Brown, 42, who is out of custody and faces the same charges, was next due in court Aug. 26.  Brown also faces a sentence-enhancement allegation for having a prior conviction for second-degree burglary in 2010 in Los Angeles County, according to the criminal complaint.  The two are accused of planting a BB gun, a 12-inch hunting knife and methamphetamine in the bed of a truck belonging to a 40-year-old woman they know on March 23, Senior Deputy District Attorney Cynthia Nichols said when the duo was charged in April.  The next morning, Beale sent an email to the Orange County Crime Stoppers organization to falsely report she saw the woman waving a gun around during an argument, Nichols said.  Beale called 911 at 11:30 a.m. that day and filed another bogus report alleging she saw the woman -- whose name was withheld -- waving a gun during an argument, the prosecutor said.  Orange County sheriff's investigators found the gun and drugs in the victim's truck when they went to her home, but she recognized the sunglasses case packed with methamphetamine as belonging to Beale and investigators turned their focus to the two defendants, according to Nichols.  Nichols declined to comment on what allegedly motivated Beale and Brown to try to get the woman arrested.

Airport Police Chief Patrick Gannon said the suspects in the alleged theft ring all underwent criminal background checks before they were authorized to work at the airport. \"It's a disappointment, but a fact of life, that sometimes a few people will succumb to the temptations at LAX,\" Gannon said. \"The actions of these few do not represent the nearly 45,000 individuals who work for the nearly 350 employers here at LAX.\" The investigation was conducted by the LAX Joint Crime Task force, which includes Airport Police and LAPD detectives. --City News Service","author_belief":null,"author_belief_highlight":null,"suspect_committedCrime":79.6666666667,"suspect_committedCrime_highlight":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.4444444444,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.3333333333,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.1666666667,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,0.6666666667,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,0.6666666667,0.8333333333,0.6666666667,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,0.6666666667,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,0.8333333333,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.8095238095,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}
{"story_id":277,"story_clean":"A Desert Hot Springs man who allegedly stabbed his sister in the face is due back in court Wednesday. Juan Angel Lopez, 38, is scheduled to appear Wednesday morning for a trial- readiness conference. He's accused of attacking his sister on Dec. 7, 2017 at a transient camp in the Desert Hot Springs. After the two argued on and off throughout the day, Lopez allegedly approached his then 35-year-old sister while she was talking to someone and stabbed her in the face with a knife, according to an arrest warrant declaration. He was originally charged in early 2018 with attempted murder, mayhem and several sentence enhancements for causing great bodily injury, but a judge dismissed the attempted murder charge in January. The nature of the argument between Lopez and his sister was not detailed in the warrant, nor was the severity of her injuries. The sister, as well as other witnesses, positively identified Lopez as the suspect, according to the declaration, which also alleges that he sent several text messages to one of the witnesses that indicated he was coming to the area to stab his sister. Lopez remains jailed in Indio in lieu of $1 million bail. --City News Service","author_belief":67.0,"author_belief_highlight":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.0,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3055555556,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0],"suspect_committedCrime":74.8333333333,"suspect_committedCrime_highlight":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.6666666667,0.1666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

Units arrived to investigate the report and soon found a male subject \"hiding in some bales of straw across the street at another business, Canton police said.  This male, identified as Mateo Martinez, 29, was on the agency's radar because he was a person of interest in other alleged trespassing of businesses in the area, including the church, Canton police said.

Jaime Jewler, 41, was arrested at her home on Sayville Avenue in Bohemia at about 1:30 p.m. Monday, police said. Jewler is also accused of attempting to rob a gas station at gunpoint.  According to police, Jewler collected donations for the cancer walk on Nov. 8 and Nov. 9. Two weeks later, on Nov. 25 at about 10:50 a.m., she entered the Gulf gas station located at 4909 Sunrise Highway in Bohemia, displayed what appeared to be a handgun and demanded money, police said. The attendant was able to wrestle the gun away from Jewler, who then fled, police said.

{"story_id":1438,"story_clean":"Police were able to stop a 30-year-old man for allegedly burglarizing a Milpitas home while a resident was still inside on Monday afternoon, a police sergeant said.  Joseph Stamaria, a Milpitas resident, was arrested on suspicion of residential burglary, resisting arrest and being under the influence of a controlled substance, police Sgt. Dave Morris said.   Officers received a call from a resident who heard glass break, noticed a neighbor's window was smashed and saw a man climbing into the home shortly before 2:30 p.m., according to Morris.  Officers responded to the scene and set up a perimeter around the residence occupied by the suspect, Morris said.   The suspect exited the home from the back and tried to jump over a fence but was faced by officers, according to Morris.  Stamaria allegedly went back to the home and ignored officers' orders to surrender, Morris said. Officers were forced to go inside the home and found Stamaria hiding in the garage, where he was arrested without incident, according to Morris.

{"story_id":1516,"story_clean":"The Baltimore County Police Department is asking for the public's help in tracking down a group of young people who broke into a Dundalk restaurant and stole cash. The department on Friday, Aug. 30, released photos and a surveillance video of the group, who walked into The Seasoned Mariner, in the 600 block of Wise Avenue. The department did not give the date of the break-in, but the video has a date stamp of April 8 (see below). The police also did not say how much money was stolen. The restaurant didn't open until 4 p.m., but at around 2:30 p.m., the individuals were caught on security cameras entering the business and stealing cash, the police said. The four alleged burglars, two young men and two young women, appear to be in their teens or 20s. They left the restaurant in a red four-door car seen in the surveillance video.  If you recognize any of these suspects or can provide police detectives with any information on this burglary, call Baltimore County police at 410-307-2020. Reward Offered\\ Metro Crime Stoppers, an organization that is separate from the Baltimore County Police Department and the county government, offers rewards for information in connection with felony offenses. If your tip leads to the arrest or indictment of a person for a felony, you could qualify for a cash reward of up to $2,000. Anonymous tips can be sent to Metro Crime Stoppers by phone, online or via mobile app. When you phone in or submit your Annapolis crime tip online or through the P3 Tips smartphone app, Metro Crime Stoppers receives your tip anonymously and only forwards your tip information to the Annapolis Police Department.

{"story_id":770,"story_clean":"Almost one year to the day of the crime, the murder case against a Fraser man accused of brutally stabbing a Macomb Township woman will move into circuit court. Initially facing counts of felony home invasion and assault with intent to commit murder, the charges against Joseph T. Reiner, 28, were upgraded to murder in December 2011 following the death of the victim, 69-year-old Joann Eisenhardt. Although DNA evidence has failed to link Reiner to Eisenhardt\u2013as Macomb County prosecutors had hoped\u2013the murder charge against him will stand based on Macomb County Medical Examiner Dr. Daniel Spitz's testimony Wednesday in 41A District Court. Spitz testified that the double stabbing Eisenhardt suffered Feb. 23, 2011, did contribute to her death in September. Based on this and other testimony offered during the last seven to eight months of Reiner's preliminary examination in district court, Judge Douglas P. Shepherd bound over the case and ordered Reiner to appear in Macomb County Circuit Court for a Feb. 27 arraignment. This story first appeared on Macomb Patch almost one year ago today. The suspect is alleged to have broken into a Macomb Township home\u00a0and stabbed a 69-year-old resident twice in the neck with two steak knives before stealing pieces of jewelry and fleeing the scene. . Just days later, Reiner was arrested following an that ended on the Tappan Zee Bridge. Months of testimony followed, during which Reiner make frequent changes to his appearance, most recently to his forehead.  in May 2011, whose testimony would have tied Reiner to Eisenhardt, has forced the prosecution rely on circumstantial evidence to make its case. Reiner will be held in the Macomb County Jail while his case is tried in Macomb County Circuit Court.","author_belief":63.2,"author_belief_highlight":[0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.6,0.6,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.3333333333,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0],"suspect_committedCrime":72.1666666667,"suspect_committedCrime_highlight":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1666666667,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.1666666667,0.0,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.1666666667,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.25,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.3333333333,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.3333333333,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667,0.1666666667]}

{"story_id":1686,"story_clean":"Three people were arrested by authorities after allegedly stripping a Seminole Heights pawn shop of $1 million in jewelry and $30,000 in cash on Friday morning, according to a report from the Tampa Police Department. Here's what happened, according to the report: A man wearing a hooded sweatshirt and a dark bandana over his face entered the Value Pawn at 5123 N. Nebraska Avenue around 9:26 a.m. on Friday. He flashed a gun and moved employees to a back room of the business. Once inside the room, the man tied up a male employee and asked a female employee to open a safe. The man took about $30,000 in cash and $1 million in jewelry before he fled. Employees activated the panic alarm at the business, and a customer called police. Authorities arrived with a K-9 and an air unit. Employees were able to identify the hooded gunman as Alexander Escarraman, 36. He was arrested by authorities a few hours after the incident. Escarraman was charged with armed robbery with a firearm, armed kidnapping with a firearm, felon in possession of a firearm and violation of probation for robbery stemming from a warrant. Their roles in the incident are unknown, but a \"substantial amount\" of cash was recovered from all three suspects, said Rebecca Jones of TPD's crime prevention team. It's unknown whether all of the cash and jewelry was recovered by authorities. No other robberies have been reported at that Value Pawn located this year, Jones said.","author_belief":52.5714285714,"author_belief_highlight":[0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.2857142857,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429],"suspect_committedCrime":66.8571428571,"suspect_committedCrime_highlight":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.5714285714,0.4285714286,0.4285714286,0.2857142857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.0,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2678571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.1428571429,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,

{"story_id":88,"story_clean":"A 24-year-old Irvine man pleaded not guilty today to charges stemming from an alleged racially motivated attack on a black teen and his older brother. Christopher Qu, who is of Asian descent, is accused of approaching the 16-year-old student about 12:50 p.m. last Wednesday at Irvine High School while the teen was waiting for a ride from his brother, said Farrah Emami of the Irvine Police Department. A pipe-wielding Qu spewed racial slurs at the boy, who was on campus for sports practice while the school was on spring break, and was advancing on the teen when his 24-year-old sibling drove up, Emami alleged. Qu banged the pipe against several railings as he advanced on the teen, Deputy District Attorney Jess Rodriguez alleged. The brother got out of the car in time to intervene, but Qu allegedly head-butted the man and slammed the pipe against his arm several times. The man, whose name was not released, sustained a broken nose and bruises on his arms, Rodriguez said. His brother was unhurt, she said. Qu was arrested nearby and police recovered a blood-spattered pipe in the school's parking lot, Emami said. Qu is charged with aggravated assault and assault with force likely to produce great bodily injury, both felonies, as well as a misdemeanor count of violating civil rights. He also faces sentence-enhancing allegations of committing a hate crime, causing great bodily injury and having a prior strike conviction for criminal threats in 2013, Rodriguez said.

{"story_id":467,"story_clean":"A man who allegedly attacked people with a machete at homeless encampments near Pajaro River was arrested in Monterey County Tuesday, sheriff's officials said. Evarado Ortiz Vargas lived at one of the encampments where he was known as \"El Diablo,\" which is Spanish for \"The Devil,\" sheriff's officials said. One of the three assaults he allegedly committed happened on Oct. 17 when deputies responded to a report of a man assaulting people with a machete near the river, sheriff's spokeswoman Jo Anna Butron said. Arriving deputies learned the suspect, later identified as Vargas, allegedly struck a woman's head with a machete, according to Butron. The transient victim was transported to Natividad Medical Center in Salinas for treatment, Butron said. Investigators were told by encampment residents of two other victims, but have only been in contact with the woman involved in the Oct. 17 assault, she said. Deputies have spent weeks searching for Vargas, who other transients said often migrated along the riverbed from Watsonville, according to Butron. Vargas is also accused of threatening people with the large knife if they refused to pay him, Butron said. Two deputies found Vargas Tuesday near the river and arrested him in connection with last week's assault, according to Butron.

The accused, whom Patch is not naming to protect the identity of the alleged victim, is facing 111 counts of numerous charges, including rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, aggravated indecent assault, corruption of minors and endangering the welfare of children. The alleged victim's mother reported the suspected crimes to police on Wednesday after, she said, her 5-year-old son told her he witnessed the girl performing oral sex on his father, the criminal affidavit said. The mother showed police a video recording of the boy recounting what he saw, the affidavit said. The alleged victim told police that the assaults began in July 2007, when her stepfather would penetrate her genitals with his fingers, making her cry, according to the affidavit. The accused told the girl that if she didn't go along with it, it would break up the family. In December 2010, the stepfather began forcing the girl to perform oral sex on him, again telling her that if she didn't do it, it would break up the family, police said. The alleged victim also said that her stepfather raped her three times between January and May 2012. The accused was arraigned before on-duty District Judge Roy Manwaring and committed to Northampton County Prison in lieu of $100,000 bail.","author_belief":80.0,"author_belief_highlight":[0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2],"suspect_committedCrime":87.4,"suspect_committedCrime_highlight":[0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2]}

{"story_id":1725,"story_clean":"Two men from Martinez and Fairfield were arrested today for allegedly attempting to steal construction equipment from a hotel garage in the East Bay and pulling guns on an employee who tried to stop them, according to police.  The suspects were identified as Edward Garofalo, 28 of Martinez and Luis Guerrero, 35 of Fairfield. Walnut Creek police were called at 11:43 a.m. to a Marriott on North Main Street in the city for the report of an attempted theft by two males who fled on foot onto nearby I-680, the department said. The men reportedly pointed guns at the hotel employee who confronted the pair, and officers spotted the duo on the freeway -- one with gun in hand, police said.  The suspects jumped a sound wall near the intersection of Riviera and Pringle avenues, where witnesses reported seeing them run into a garage on the 100 block of Pringle, police said. Walnut Creek officers set up a perimeter around the building and within minutes both suspects were seen fleeing. After a short foot chase, the two were apprehended without further incident, police said. Two firearms were recovered, police said. Garofalo and Guerrero were arrested on numerous charges including suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon, brandishing firearms, being felons in possession of firearms, carrying concealed weapons, carrying a loaded firearm in a public place and conspiracy to commit crime. Guerrero was also arrested for suspected possession of stolen property and on a warrant for violating the terms of his Post Release Community Supervision, police said. --Photos via WCPD","author_belief":71.2857142857,"author_belief_highlight":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.2857142857,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.2857142857,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429,0.1428571429],"suspect_committedCrime":84.125,"suspect_committedCrime_highlight":[0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.0,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.125,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.125,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

{"story_id":1131,"story_clean":"If you're allegedly carrying illegal substances on your person, one surefire way to catch the eye of the law\u00a0is to commit a traffic\u00a0violation along a well-traveled stretch of highway\u2014and that's exactly what Collingswood police say a trio of suspects did that led to their eventual arrests. On October 16, police stopped two men at the\u00a0intersection of Route 30 and 130 for allegedly improperly crossing the highway. The officer escorted the men back to the\u00a0patrol vehicle to issue a summons, when one of them\u00a0allegedly\u00a0ran off.\u00a0 After a brief foot chase,\u00a0Eric Larmour, 43, of Tuckerton, was apprehended in the 100 block of Richie Avenue. Police said Larmour was\u00a0found to be in possession of nine, clear, plastic bags containing purported crack-cocaine.\u00a0 The other man,\u00a0Brian Larmour, 40, also of Tuckerton, was charged for possession of a controlled, dangerous substance (CDS).\u00a0 Police also discovered that Brian Larmour\u00a0was\u00a0wanted on active warrants in multiple counties for crimes ranging from operating a motor vehicle with a license suspended for\u00a0DWI to\u00a0motor vehicle\u00a0burglary. He was remanded to the Camden County correctional facility. A similar situation occurred at 10 a.m. on November 10 at the same location.\u00a0 While on patrol in the area of Route 130 and the White Horse Pike, police said\u00a0Lisa Payakovich allegedly\u00a0did not use the crosswalk to walk her bicycle across the highway. Payakovich, 46, of Haddon Heights,\u00a0was stopped, and was unable to provide any identification.\u00a0 Police asked if she was in possession of any contraband or illegal substances, and Payakovich allegedly\u00a0surrendered four bags of purported heroin. She was released on a summons pending a court date. All information provided by\u00a0Collingswood Police.

In the Tribune article, Khan's attorney said releasing him before the trial would allow him to get counseling services and develop critical thinking skills in an effort to keep him from becoming radicalized.  Khan was arrested Oct. 4 at O'Hare Airport attempting to board a flight to Vienna with his younger sister and brother. Khan has been charged with one count of attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization. His sister and brother have not been charged with a crime.

{"story_id":861,"story_clean":"and some chili powder -- to stop an armed robbery on Saturday night.  Stoneham Police arrested a Revere man the next morning for allegedly taking part in a botched robbery at C-Store convenience store on Main Street. Brett R. Osgood, 25, of Revere, was arrested after an investigation and charged with: \u2022 Attempt to Commit a Crime (Armed Robbery) \u2022 Malicious or Wanton Destruction of Property \u2022 Assault with a Dangerous Weapon \u2022 Assault and Battery with a Dangerous Weapon \u2022 Witness Intimidation According to the Police Department, Osgood went into the store late Saturday evening and bought a $2 scratch ticket. A short time later, the Revere man returned with another man, who was in his 40s. They attempted to cash the scratch ticket.  When the clerk opened the register, one of men showed a firearm and ordered the clerk to give him money.  The clerk refused and the second suspect hit the clerk several times in the face, but the clerk ran away and tried to call police.  Both suspects tried to open the drawer, but they were unsuccessful, which is when the clerk threw chili powder in the robbers' faces. The men fled, but the clerk followed them and wrote down their license plate.  The license plate belonged to Osgood and the clerk gave a positive ID of Osgood. Police are still seeking the second suspect, and the case remains under investigation. \"The clerk in this situation showed incredible bravery, but we would, of course, never recommend that someone try to fight off a robber who is pointing a gun at you,\" Chief James\u00a0McIntyre said. \"We are pleased that no one was seriously hurt.\" Osgood will be arraigned in Woburn District Court later today.","author_belief":65.4,"author_belief_highlight":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.8,0.8,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0],"suspect_committedCrime":83.6,"suspect_committedCrime_highlight":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.8,0.0333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}
